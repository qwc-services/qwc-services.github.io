# Updating to qwc-permalink-service-v2024.12.14 \[2024-lts &rarr; 2025-lts\]

When updating to `qwc-permalink-service-v2024.12.14`, make sure to also update to `qwc-config-db-migrate-v2024.12.14` to update the schema of the `user_bookmarks` table. The bookmarks are now stored by user id instead of username.

# qwc-services v2024.11.18 mass update update \[2024-lts &rarr; 2025-lts\]

As a result of `PyJWT` 2.10.0 enforcing that the JWT `sub` claim values must be strings, `qwc-services-core` 1.3.34 was updated to store the qwc identity in a separate `qwc_identity` claim, and all QWC images were updated to use this version. Consequently, if you use any QWC Service image version v2024.11.18 or newer, you will also need to update any other QWC Service image to this or a newer version to ensure that correct that the JWTs are issued and read correctly by all services.

# New qwc-document-service, jasper-reporting-service obsolete \[2024-lts &rarr; 2025-lts\]

As of 2024.09.15, the `jasper-reporting-service` is obsolete, its functionality has been integrated into the `qwc-document-service`. Check out the new [Reports](../topics/Reports.md) chapter to learn more about integrating the reporting functionality into QWC2.

# Split categorized layers functionality rewritten as QGIS Server plugin \[2024-lts &rarr; 2025-lts\]

As of 2024.02.02 the split categorized layers functionality previously part of `qwc-config-generator` has been rewritten as a [QGIS Server plugin](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-qgis-server-plugins/tree/main/split_categorized).

This greatly simplifies the handling of such projects. The `-noqgis` image tag suffix in `qwc-config-generator:vXXXX-noqgis` has been dropped resp. shipped as the regular `qwc-config-generator:vXXXX` docker images.

See the [categorized layers documentation](https://qwc-services.github.io/master/configuration/ThemesConfiguration/#split-categorized-layers) for instructions how to configure the new `split_categorized` plugin.

# Updating to qwc-data-service v2024.05.21 \[2024-lts &rarr; 2025-lts\]

The `qwc-data-service` version 2024.05.21 introduces two now logging fields `create_user_field` and `create_timestamp_field`. Record creation will now be logged to these fields, if set, and record updates will be logged to `edit_user_field` and `edit_timestamp_field`. Previously, both record creation and updates were logged to `edit_user_field` and `edit_timestamp_field`. As of v2024.05.21, you need to set `create_user_field` and `create_timestamp_field` (also to the same values as `edit_user_field` and `edit_timestamp_field`) if you want to log creation.

# 2023.10.24 qwc-base-db rework \[2023-lts &rarr; 2024-lts\]

As of 2023.10.24 the QWC base DB image has been reworked as follows:

* Migrations were moved to the `qwc-base-db` repository, the `qwc-config-db` repository is now obsolete.
* A new `qwc-base-db-migrate` image helps migrating dockerized or external config DBs.
* Demo data will be initialized by an optional setup script in `qwc-docker`, the `qwc-demo-db` repository is now obsolete.

To use the new images, replace

```yml
  qwc-postgis:
    image: docker.io/sourcepole/qwc-demo-db:<version>
  ...
```

with

```yml
  qwc-postgis:
    image: sourcepole/qwc-base-db:<pg_version>
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '' # TODO: Set your postgres password here!
    volumes:
     - ./volumes/db:/var/lib/postgresql/docker
     # If you don't want/need the demo data, you can remove this line
     - ./volumes/demo-data/setup-demo-data.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/2_setup-demo-data.sh
    ports:
     - "127.0.0.1:5439:5432"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 10s

  qwc-config-db-migrate:
    image: sourcepole/qwc-base-db-migrate:<version>
    volumes:
     - ./pg_service.conf:/tmp/pg_service.conf:ro
    depends_on:
     - qwc-postgis
```

in your `docker-compose.yml`.

Note:

- It is now mandatory to set your own `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
- You can keep your previous `volumes/db` postgres data folder, but it is recommended to make a backup.
* The `sourcepole/qwc-base-db` images are versioned according to the Postgres major version (i.e. 13, 14, 15, ...).
* The `sourcepole/qwc-base-db-migrate` images are versioned by date (`vYYYY.MM.DD`)
- See the [`qwc-base-db` README](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-base-db) for more information.
- As of `2023.10.24` the name of the database was changed to the more generic `qwc_services` instead of `qwc_demo`.

# Upgrading to qwc service images v2022.01.26

The `qwc-uwsgi-base` images have been changed to allow for configurable UID/GID of the `uwsgi` process. The default is `UID=33` and `GID=33`, you can override it by setting the `SERVICE_UID` and `SERVICE_GID` environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

As a consequence, `/var/www` is not necessarily anymore the home directory of the user wich runs `uwsgi`, and therefore the `qwc-uwsgi-base` images now set `ENV PGSERVICEFILE="/srv/pg_service.conf"`. You'll therefore need to adapt your `pg_service.conf` volume mounts in your `docker-compose.yml` to point to that location, i.e.

    [...]
    - ./pg_service.conf:/srv/pg_service.conf:ro
    [...]

# Upgrading to qwc-config-generator-v2022.01.12

- `scanned_projects_path_prefix` has been dropped as a config setting. Instead, `qgis_projects_scan_base_dir` must be a directory below `qgis_projects_base_dir`, and the prefix is automatically computed internally.
- `scanned_projects_path_prefix` has been added as a config setting as the output path for preprocessed qgis projects. It must be a directory below `qgis_projects_base_dir` to which the config service is allowed to write.

# Upgrading from qwc service images v2021.x to v2022.01.08 or later

Starting with v2022.01.08, the requirements of all services where updated to use Flask-JWT-Extended 4.3.1.

Flask-JWT-4.x changes the JWT format (see [4.0.0 Breaking Changes](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/v4_upgrade_guide.html#encoded-jwt-changes-important)), which can result in QWC Services returning a `Missing claim: identity` error message.

To avoid this:
* Change your JWT secret key in `.env`.
* Ensure all services are upgraded to v2022.01.12 or later (if such a version exists). Please omit v2022.01.08 and v2022.01.11.
