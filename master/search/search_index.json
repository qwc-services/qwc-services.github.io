It describes some of the available features. Note : Depending on the specific viewer configuration, some functionalities might be missing or different than described in this section. Overview \u00b6 QGIS Web Client is composed of some essential features for the user to be able to navigate through its GIS data. The user interface is composed of : a map : navigate through your GIS data, zoom, pan a toolbar : configure some shortcuts for tools (none in this example) a logo : customize your application with your company logo a searchbar : search in the application according to configurable search providers a menu : navigate through all the tools and features of the application a scalebar : see what is the current scale of the map a coordinates display according to the mouse position in several configurable CRS (Coordinates Reference System) a drop-down list of scales : set the zoom of the map at a pre-defined scale shortcuts : configure shortcut buttons for some features (Show Layer Tree for example) home button : set the extent of the map at the home extent defined in your QGIS project location button : zoom at the location of your device zoom buttons : zoom in or out the map a background switcher : change background layer among those configured in the application attributions : links to the attributions data terms of use : links to the terms of use of the application Basic features \u00b6 Menu \u00b6 Here is a minimalist menu of the application with basic features : Theme \u00b6 Theme menu lists all the published QGIS projects in the application. One theme is linked to one QGIS project . You can switch from one to another by clicking on corresponding thumbnails. Then, the map is updated with data of the selected theme. Themes can be sorted in groups. You can also open a theme in a new tab, add a whole theme to the current map (to display several projects at the same time) or add some layers of a theme to the current one. Layers & Legend \u00b6 Layers & Legend menu allows user to show or hide any layer (or group of layers) on the map. Each layer comes from a published QGIS project (or theme ), or from an external WMS/WFS, or local file. On the top of this menu, you can print the legend of the displayed theme by clicking the print button. This will open a new window, where you can print this legend. The eye button is used to filter layers that are not visible. The trash button is used to remove all the layers displayed in the current map. You can retrieve layers from a QGIS project by selecting a theme in Theme menu. The i button displays a new window with all the informations about the current theme. These informations are retrieved from the QGIS project properties. For each layer, user can: remove the layer by clicking the trash button. This removes the layer only for the current context of the user, not for all the users. If the layer comes from the QGIS project, you can retrieve the deleted one by selecting the theme in Theme menu. change the order of display, by clicking up and down arrows buttons change opacity with the slider zoom on the layer extent with the magnifying glass button display layer legend by hovering the image on the left of the layer name or by clicking the i button (new window displaying info about the layer retrieved from QGIS project) The Show layer map tips option is used to display a tooltip when hovering an object on the map. It needs you have configured a map tip in layers properties. The Compare top layer option splits the map into two parts. On the left side, top layer (in the tree) is displayed while it is not on the right side. You can move the slider on the map to see the differences between the two sides. The Import layer submenu allows user to add some external data to the current map. You can configure some predefined URLs in the application. For example, Swisstopo WMTS is a predefined entry in the demo application which queries https://wmts10.geo.admin.ch/EPSG/2056/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml . You can also add other URLs that are not predefined in the application, https://wxs.ign.fr/clc/geoportail/r/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities if you want to add french Corine Land Cover data. By clicking on connect, there is a list of data available from the entered URL and you can add some of the layers to your current map by clicking on them. In the Import layer submenu, you can also import local files to the current map. Only some formats are supported ( GeoJSON , JSON , KML ). Map Tools \u00b6 In the Map Tools menu, user can retrieve some basic features of GIS webclient : * identify objects * measuring tools * drawing tools * export image Identify \u00b6 To identify an object and get attribute values, you can click directly on the map. If an object is present at the click position, there is a request sent to QGIS Server to get attributes of the clicked object. Results are displayed in a window with all objects identified. Geometry of queried objects are highlighted. You can zoom on an object extent, or browse results one by one in the Feature Info panel. Finally, you can export results of all identified objects ( JSON , GeoJSON , CSV or CSV + ZIP ). To be able to query an object, layer must be configured as queryable in the QGIS project (check the Identifiable checkbox in Project \u2192 Properties \u2192 Data Sources in your QGIS project). Identify Region \u00b6 User can also use Identify Region tool to identify multiple objects in the same time. Draw a polygon around the features to identify to get the results. Measure \u00b6 Measuring tools can be used to retrieve position, object length, object area, ... Values can be copied to clipboard with the copy button. Position \u00b6 Click on the map to get coordinates. Coordinates are displayed according to selected CRS in bottom bar of the application (here WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator ). Length \u00b6 Draw a polyline on the map to measure the length of each segment and the sum of all these lengths. User can choose the units of measurement ( meters , feet , kilometers , miles ). Area \u00b6 Draw a polygon on the map to measure an area. User can choose the units of measurement ( square meters , square feet , square kilometers , square miles , hectares ). Bearing \u00b6 Draw a line on the map to get the bearing angle of this line (angle from start point to end point). Redlining \u00b6 In Redlining tool, user can add some annotations to the map in different temporary layers. The default layer in which you can add annotations is named Redlining . You can add new layers by clicking + button. Drawing layers are available in Layers & Legend menu. Drawing options are : * point * polyline * polygon * circle * text For each object, you can set border color, fill color, size. Fill the label entry to set text on your object. Once you have drawn objects, you can edit them by picking one and change options. Pick an object and click on trash button to delete it. Buffer option is used to create a buffer around the selected object. Raster Export \u00b6 Raster Export tool allows the user to export a screenshot of the map in an image ( png , jpeg ) at a specified resolution ( 96 dpi , 300 dpi ). Draw a rectangle on the map to export a region in an image. An image is opened in a new tab and you can save it on your computer with the specified format and resolution. Print \u00b6 With Print menu, you can export a layout configured in your QGIS project as PDF file. When clicking on the menu, a list of all available layouts of the theme (QGIS project) is displayed. You can set some options : scale, rotation, grid and custom text (if configured in the layout). Result is displayed in a new tab or in a window in the application. Then, you can save it in a file or print it. Help \u00b6 By default, Help menu displays the build date of the application. You can also customize this menu to have a link to the QWC User documentation. External Link \u00b6 External Link menu can be used to have a link to other resources. For example, your company site.","title":"User guide"},{"location":"UserGuide/#user-guide","text":"This section contains user documentation of the QWC2 application and QWC services.

That backend can be reached by default at http://localhost:8088/qwc_admin . The configuration backend allows to assign users and groups to roles. The roles in their turn can receive permissions on resources. These configuration settings will be stored in the configuration database . Out of the box qwc-docker comes with with a container qwc-postgis that contains the configuration database. Users, groups and roles \u00b6 Roles can be given permissions on resources. That means that if you want to give users or groups permissions on resources, then you have to first create a role, configure the permissions that the roles has on some resources, and then assign the role the users or groups. Resources \u00b6 The following resource types are available: Map : WMS corresponding to a QGIS Project Layer : layer of a map Attribute : attribute of a map layer Print template : print composer template of a QGIS Project Data : Data layer for editing Attribute : attribute of a data layer Data (create) : Data layer for creating features Data (read) : Data layer for reading features Data (update) : Data layer for updating features Data (delete) : Data layer for deleting features Viewer : custom map viewer configuration Viewer task : permittable viewer tasks FeatureInfo service : Feature info service FeatureInfo layer : Feature info layer The resource name corresponds to the technical name of its resource (e.g. WMS layer name). Most notably, the name of a map resource corresponds to the relative path to the project below qgs-resources without .qgs extension (so i.e. the resource name for qgs-resources/subfolder/project.qgs will be subfolder/project ). Note: If your QGIS project is configured to return the field aliases rather than the field names in GetFeatureInfo , the resource name for layer attribute resources corresponds to the alias of the field. Available map , layer , attribute and print_template resources are determined from WMS GetProjectSettings and the QGIS projects. data and their attribute resources define a data layer for the Data service . For more detailed CRUD permissions data_create , data_read , data_update and data_delete can be used instead of data ( data and write=False is equivalent to data_read ; data and write=True is equivalent to all CRUD resources combined). The viewer resource defines a custom viewer configuration for the map viewer (see Custom viewer configurations ). The viewer_task resource defines viewer functionalities (e.g. printing or raster export) that can be restricted or permitted. Their name (e.g. RasterExport ) corresponds to the key in menuItems and toolbarItems in the QWC2 config.json . Restricted viewer task items are then removed from the menu and toolbar in the map viewer. Viewer tasks not explicitly added as resources are kept unchanged from the config.json . Note : The resource types, i.e. for custom QWC2 plugins, can be extended by inserting new types into the qwc_config.resource_types table. These can be queried, e.g. in a custom service, by using PermissionClient::resource_permissions() or PermissionClient::resource_restrictions() from QWC Services Core . Permissions \u00b6 Permissions are based on roles. Roles can be assigned to groups or users, and users can be members of groups. A special role is \"public\". The \"public\" role applies always, no matter whether a user is signed in or is not signed in. Roles can be assigned permission for resources. The write flag is only used for data resources and determines whether a data layer is read-only. Based on the user's identity (user name and/or group name), all corresponding roles and their permissions and restrictions are collected. The service configurations are then modified according to these permissions and restrictions. By using the permissions_default_allow configuration setting in tenantConfig.json , some resources can be set to be permitted or restricted by default if no permissions are set (default: false ). Among affected resources are Map , Layer , Print template , Viewer task , FeatureInfo service , FeatureInfo layer . E.g.: permissions_default_allow=true : all maps and layers are permitted by default permissions_default_allow=false : maps and layers are only available if their resources and permissions are explicitly configured Restricted themes \u00b6 The display behaviour of restricted themes can be configured in the mapViewer service configuration in tenantConfig.json as follows: { \"name\": \"mapViewer\", \"config\": { \"show_restricted_themes\": false, \"show_restricted_themes_whitelist\": [], \"redirect_restricted_themes_to_auth\": false, \"internal_permalink_service_url\": \"http://qwc-permalink-service:9090\" } } show_restricted_themes : Whether to show placeholder items for restricted themes. Default: false . show_restricted_themes_whitelist : Whitelist of restricted theme names to display as placeholders. If empty, all restricted themes are shown. Only used if show_restricted_themes enabled. Default: [] . redirect_restricted_themes_to_auth : Whether to redirect to login on auth service if requesting a restricted theme in URL params, if not currently signed in. Default: false . internal_permalink_service_url : Internal permalink service URL for getting the theme from a resolved permalink for redirecting to login (default: http://qwc-permalink-service:9090 ). This is used only if redirect_restricted_themes_to_auth is enabled and permalink_service_url is set. Permissions file \u00b6 The QWC Config Generator generates a JSON file for all permissions from the QWC ConfigDB. See READMEs of QWC services for service specific contents in permissions.json .

Most notably, the name of a map resource corresponds to the relative path to the project below qgs-resources without .qgs extension (so i.e. the resource name for qgs-resources/subfolder/project.qgs will be subfolder/project ). Note: If your QGIS project is configured to return the field aliases rather than the field names in GetFeatureInfo , the resource name for layer attribute resources corresponds to the alias of the field. Available map , layer , attribute and print_template resources are determined from WMS GetProjectSettings and the QGIS projects. data and their attribute resources define a data layer for the Data service . For more detailed CRUD permissions data_create , data_read , data_update and data_delete can be used instead of data ( data and write=False is equivalent to data_read ; data and write=True is equivalent to all CRUD resources combined). The viewer resource defines a custom viewer configuration for the map viewer (see Custom viewer configurations ). The viewer_task resource defines viewer functionalities (e.g. printing or raster export) that can be restricted or permitted. Their name (e.g. RasterExport ) corresponds to the key in menuItems and toolbarItems in the QWC2 config.json . Restricted viewer task items are then removed from the menu and toolbar in the map viewer. Viewer tasks not explicitly added as resources are kept unchanged from the config.json . Note : The resource types, i.e. for custom QWC2 plugins, can be extended by inserting new types into the qwc_config.resource_types table. These can be queried, e.g. in a custom service, by using PermissionClient::resource_permissions() or PermissionClient::resource_restrictions() from QWC Services Core .","title":"Resources"},{"location":"configuration/ResourcesPermissions/#permissions","text":"Permissions are based on roles. Roles can be assigned to groups or users, and users can be members of groups. A special role is \"public\".

The write flag is only used for data resources and determines whether a data layer is read-only. Based on the user's identity (user name and/or group name), all corresponding roles and their permissions and restrictions are collected. The service configurations are then modified according to these permissions and restrictions. By using the permissions_default_allow configuration setting in tenantConfig.json , some resources can be set to be permitted or restricted by default if no permissions are set (default: false ). Among affected resources are Map , Layer , Print template , Viewer task , FeatureInfo service , FeatureInfo layer .

The basic steps for configuring a theme are: Create a QGIS project and deploy it to QGIS Server Writing the QWC2 theme configuration Generating the themes configuration Creating and publishing a QGIS project \u00b6 The first step is to prepare a QGIS project for publishing. Besides the common tasks of adding and styling layers, the following table gives an overview of settings which influence how the theme is displayed in QWC2: What Where Description Service Metadata Project Properties \u2192 QGIS Server \u2192 Service capabilities Shown in the theme info dialog, invokable from the Layer Tree panel titlebar.

Print layout labels Layout manager Print layout labels with an ID will be exposed in the Print plugin. Note: a label ID starting with __ will not be exposed. Attribute form Vector Layer Properties \u2192 Attributes Form The configured attribute form will be displayed when editing in QWC2. External layers Layer Properties \u2192 QGIS Server \u2192 Data URL Mark the layer as an external layer to avoid cascaded requests. See Configuring external layers . Then, store the project in the publishing directory of your QGIS Server instance. When using qwc-docker , store the project as *.qgs below qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources . Alternatively, when using qwc-docker , you can also store the project in a database in QGIS using Project \u2192 Save To \u2192 PostgreSQL (see Storing projects in database ). Ensuring valid datasources \u00b6 A common issue is that the project will reference datasources in locations which cannot be resolved when QGIS Server reads the project, in particular when running QGIS Server inside a docker container. To avoid such issues: Make sure that any file-based resources are located on the same level or below the level of the *.qgs project file. Remember to copy all resources along with the *.qgs project file to the server. Load any PostgreSQL datasource in QGIS using a service, and make sure the service definition exists both in the pg_service.conf on your host system as well as in the qwc_docker/pg_service.conf and qwc_docker/pg_service-write.conf which are mounted inside the docker containers. For instance, to use default qwc-docker database, use the qwc_geodb service and add the service definition to your host pg_service.conf as follows: [qwc_geodb] host=localhost port=5439 dbname=qwc_demo user=qwc_service password=qwc_service sslmode=disable Configuring the themes in themesConfig.json \u00b6 The next step is to configure the theme for QWC2. There are two approaches: Automatic theme configuration (only when using qwc-docker ): Just copy the project file to the designated location and the qwc-config-generator will automatically generate a theme configuration using default parameters. Manual theme configuration : Manually configure a theme with the full set of configuration options. Automatic theme configuration \u00b6 When using qwc-docker , save your QGIS projects below qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources/scan . Adjust the default settings ( defaultMapCrs , defaultBackgroundLayers , etc.) as desired in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tentant>/themesConfig.json . Then generate the theme configuration . You can configure an automatically configured theme as default theme by setting defaultTheme in themesConfig.json to the path to the QGIS project file below qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources , without the .qgs extension. For example to set qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources/scan/project.qgs as default theme, you'd write ... \"defaultTheme\": \"scan/project\" ... To use a custom thumbnail for an automatically configured theme, place a an image called <project_basename>.png in qwc-docker/volumes/qwc2/assets/img/mapthumbs . For example. if the project is called project_name.qgs , the name thumbnail image would be named project_name.png . Note: The auto-scan directory can be is controlled by qgis_projects_scan_base_dir in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tentant>/themesConfig.json . Manual theme configuration \u00b6 The theme configuration file is located as follows: Standalone viewer: qwc2-app/themesConfig.json qwc-docker : qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tentant>/themesConfig.json Note : when using qwc-docker , the themes configuration may also be embedded as themesConfig directly in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tentant>/tenantConfig.json . The themesConfig.json file contains a list of themes, optionally organized in groups, as well as a list of background layers: { \"themes\": { \"items\": [ { <ThemeDefinition> }, ... ], \"groups\": [ { \"title\": <Group title>, \"items\": [{ <ThemeDefinition> }, ...], \"groups\": [ { <Group> }, ...] }, ... ], \"externalLayers\": [ { <ExternalLayerDefinition> }, ... ], \"themeInfoLinks\": [ { <ThemeInfoLinkDefinition> }, ... ], \"pluginData\": { \"<PluginName>\": [{ <PluginDataReource>}, ...], ... }, \"backgroundLayers\": [ { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> }, ... ], }, \"defaultMapCrs\": \"<Default map crs, defaults to EPSG:3857>\", \"defaultBackgroundLayers\": \"<Default background layers, see theme definition below>\", \"defaultWMSVersion\": \"<Default WMS version, i.e. 1.3.0>\", \"defaultScales\": [<Scale denominators, see theme definition below>], \"defaultPrintScales\" [<Scale denominators, see theme definition below>], \"defaultPrintResolutions\": [<DPIs, see theme definition below>], \"defaultSearchProviders\": [<Search providers, see theme definition below>], \"defaultPrintGrid\": [<Print grid, see theme definition below>], \"defaultTheme\": \"<Default theme id>\" } Refer to External layers , Theme info links , Plugin data and Background layers for the format of the respective definitions. Refer to the sample themesConfig.json for a complete example. The format of the theme definitions is as follows: Entry Description \"id\": \"<id>\", Theme identificator.

When using qwc-docker , the url can be specified as /ows/<relative_path_to_qgs> where relative_path_to_qgs is the path to the QGIS project file below qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources , without the .qgs extension. In the above sample, the project file would be located at qwc-docker/volumes/qgs-resources/my_theme.qgs . External layers \u00b6 External layers can be used to selectively replace layers in a QGIS project with a layer from an external source, for instance in the case of a WMS layer embedded in a QGIS project, to avoid cascading WMS requests. They are handled transparently by QWC2 (they are positioned in the layer tree identically to the internal layer they replace), but the GetMap and GetFeatureInfo requests are sent directly to the specified WMS Service. Configuring external layers via Data Url The simplest way to define an external layer is to set the \"Data Url\" for a layer in QGIS (Layer Properties \u2192 QGIS Server \u2192 Data Url) to a string of these forms wms:<service_url>?<options>#<layername> wmts:<capabilities_url>?<options>#<layername> mvt:<tile_url>|<style_url> For instance: wms:http://wms.geo.admin.ch?tiled=false&infoFormat=application/geojson#ch.are.bauzonen wmts:https://wmts10.geo.admin.ch/EPSG/2056/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml?crs=EPSG:2056#ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill mvt:https://kataster.bev.gv.at/tiles/kataster/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf|https://kataster.bev.gv.at/styles/kataster/style_vermv.json Note: Support for WMTS/MVT in Data Url is currently only implemented when using qwc-docker . Note: You can pass parameters which control the behaviour of the WMS client in QGIS Server by prefexing the parameters with extwms. when the layer is requested by QGIS Server, i.e. when printing. Example to override the step width/heigth of the QGIS WMS Client: wms:http://wms.geo.admin.ch?extwms.stepWidth=4096&extwms.stepHeight=4096#ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe-pk1000.noscale Manually configuring external layers Rather than setting the \"Data Url\", you can provide a manual ExternalLayerDefinition as follows: Entry Description { \u2063 \"name\": \"<external_layer_name>\", The name of the external layer, as referenced in the theme definitions. \u2063 \"type\": \"<layer_type>\", Layer type, \"wms\" or \"wmts\" \u2063 \"url\": \"<wms_baseurl>\", The WMS URL or WMTS resource URL for the external layer. } For external WMS layers, the following additional parameters apply: Entry Description \"params\": { Parameters for the GetMap request. \u2063 \"LAYERS\": \"<wms_layername>,...\" , Comma-separated list of WMS layer names. \u2063 \"OPACITIES\": \"<0-255>,...\" Optional, if WMS server supports opacities. }, \"featureInfoUrl\": \"<wms_featureinfo_baseurl>\", Optional, base URL for WMS GetFeatureInfo, if different from url . \"legendUrl\": \"<wms_legendgraphic_baseurl>\" , Optional, base URL for WMS GetLegendGraphic, if different from url . \"queryLayers\": [\"<wms_featureinfo_layername>\", ...], Optional, list of GetFeatureInfo query layers, if different from params.LAYERS . \"infoFormats\": [\"<featureinfo_format>\", ...] List of GetFeatureInfo query formats which the WMS service supports. For external WMTS layers, the following additional parameters apply (you can use the qwc2/scripts/wmts_config_generator.py script to obtain these values): Entry Description \"tileMatrixSet\": \"<tile_matrix_set_name>\", The name of the tile matrix set. \"originX\": <origin_x>, The X origin of the tile matrix. \"originY\": <origin_y>, The Y origin of the tile matrix. \"projection\": \"EPSG:<code>\", The layer projection. \"resolutions\": [<resolution>, ...], The list of WMTS resolutions. \"tileSize\": [<tile_width>, <tile_height>] The tile width and height. Theme info links \u00b6 You can specify links to display in an info-menu next to the respective theme title in the theme switcher entries. The format of a ThemeInfoLinkDefinition is as follows: Entry Description \"name\": \"<link_name>\", The name of the link, as referenced in the theme definitions. \"title\": \"<link_title>\", The title for the link, as displayed in the info menu of the theme entry in the theme switcher. \"url\": \"<link>\", A link URL. \"target\": \"<link_target>\" The link target, i.e. _blank . Note : When using qwc-services , theme info links must be explicitly permitted by creating appropriate Theme info link resources and permissions in the qwc-admin-gui . Plugin data \u00b6 Plugin data is useful to provide a per-theme configuration for custom plugins. The format for a PluginDataReource is as follows: Entry Description \"name\": \"<resource_name>\", The name of the resource. \"...\": ..., Arbitrary additional fields. Note : When using qwc-services , theme plugin data entries must be explicitly permitted by creating appropriate Plugin data resources (as child of a respective Plugin resource) and permissions in the qwc-admin-gui . Background layers \u00b6 Background layers are handled completely client-side and do not appear in the layer tree. The format of the background layer definitions is as follows: Entry Description \"name\": \"<Name>\", The name of the background layer, used in the theme definitions. \"title\": \"<Title>\", The title of the background layer, as displayed in the background switcher. \"titleMsgId\": \"<Title msgID>\", Alternative to title , a message ID, translated through the translation files. \"thumbnail\": \"<Filename>\", Optional, image file in assets/img/mapthumbs (see Viewer assets ). Defaults to img/mapthumbs/default.jpg . \"type\": \"<Type>\", The background layer type, i.e. wms or wmts . \"attribution\": \"<Attribution>\", Optional, attribution which will be shown in the bottom right corner of the map. \"attributionUrl\": \"<URL>\", Optional, link associated to the attribution \"group\": \"<GroupId>\", Optional, a group ID string. Background layers with the same group ID will be grouped together in the background switcher. \"minScale\": <min_scale>, Optional, minimum scale denominator from which to render the layer. \"maxScale\": <max_scale>, Optional, maximum scale denominator from which to render the layer. \"layerConfig\": {...}, Optional, extra OpenLayers layer configuration, according to the API of the specific layer type. \"sourceConfig\": {...}, Optional, extra OpenLayers source configuration, according to the API of the specific source type. <Layer params> Parameters according to the specified layer type. Some minimal examples of supported background layers: WMS : { \"name\": \"swissboundaries\", \"type\":\"wms\", \"url\":\"https://wms.geo.admin.ch\", \"params\": { \"LAYERS\": \"ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill\", \"VERSION\": \"1.3.0\", ... } } WMTS : { \"name\":\"bluemarble\", \"type\":\"wmts\", \"url\":\"http://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg3857/best/BlueMarble_ShadedRelief/default/{TileMatrixSet}/{TileMatrix}/{TileRow}/{TileCol}.jpeg\", \"bbox\":{ \"bounds\":[-180.0,-85.051129,180.0,85.051129], \"crs\":\"EPSG:4326\" }, \"originX\":-20037508.34278925, \"originY\":20037508.34278925, \"projection:\":\"EPSG:3857\", \"resolutions\":[156543.03390625,78271.516953125,39135.7584765625,19567.87923828125,9783.939619140625,4891.9698095703125,2445.9849047851562,1222.9924523925781], \"tileMatrixPrefix\":\"\", \"tileMatrixSet\":\"GoogleMapsCompatible_Level8\", \"tileSize\":[256,256] } Note : You can use the helper python script located at qwc2/scripts/wmts_config_generator.py to easily generate WMTS background layer configurations. OpenStreetMap : { \"name\":\"mapnik\", \"type\":\"osm\" } Bing : { \"name\": \"bing\", \"type\": \"bing\", \"apiKey\": \"<get from https://www.bingmapsportal.com/>\", \"imagerySet\": \"<Aerial|AerialWithLabelsOnDemand|RoadOnDemand|CanvasDark|OrdnanceSurvey>\" } XYZ : { \"name\": \"OpenCycleMap\", \"type\": \"xyz\", \"url\":\"https://{a-c}.tile.thunderforest.com/cycle/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" } VectorTiles : (note: if the tile projection is not EPSG:3857 , you need to specifiy projection and tileGridConfig . If labels are cropped you could also set declutter to true ) { \"name\": \"mvt_example\", \"type\": \"mvt\", \"url\": \"http://foobar.baz/tileset/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf\", \"style\": \"http://foobar.baz/style.json\", \"declutter\": false, \"projection\": \"EPSG:XXXX\", \"tileGridConfig\": { \"origin\": [<x>, <y>], \"resolutions\": [<resolutions>] } } Alternatively, WMS and WMTS background layers can also be defined specifiying a resource identifier, which will then be resolved at runtime. For example: { \"name\":\"ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-grau\", \"title\":\"National map (gray)\", \"resource\": \"wmts:https://wmts10.geo.admin.ch/EPSG/2056/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml#ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-grau\", \"thumbnail\":\"img/mapthumbs/default.jpg\" } A background layer definition can also be a group of layers, in the format { \"name\": \"<Name>\", \"title\": \"<Title>\", \"type\": \"group\", \"items\": [ { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> }, { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> }, ... ] } Instead of specifiying a full background layer definition in a group, you can also reference an existing one with \"ref\": \"<bg_layer_name>\" , and selectively override certain properties, such as minScale and maxScale : { ... \"items\": [ { \"ref\": \"<bg_layer_name>\", \"minScale\": <min_scale>, \"maxScale\": <max_scale> }, ... ] } Generating the themes configuration \u00b6 The file ultimately read by the QWC2 viewer is the themes.json configuration, which includes the contents of themesConfig.json completed with additional data obtained from the QGIS Project. When using qwc-docker , you can generate the themes from the qwc-admin-gui administration backend, running on http://localhost:8088/qwc_admin by default. Log in as admin user, then press the green Generate service configuration button. This will invoce the qwc-config-generator , which will generate mapViewerConfig.json located below qwc-docker/volumes/config/<tentant> . You can then inspect the generated themes.json at http://localhost:8088/themes.json . When using QWC2 as a standalone viewer, the themes.json can be generated by invoking yarn run themesconfig Note: this command is automatically invoked when starting the development server via yarn start . If working in an environment without node, using the equivalent command python3 qwc2/scripts/themesConfig.py If you want to manage multiple themesConfig.json files, you can specify which while should be processed by the theme generation script via the QWC2_THEMES_CONFIG environment variable. Storing projects in database \u00b6 When you are using qwc-docker , you can configure QWC to read the QGIS projects directly from the database. To do this, proceed as follows: Set up a PostgreSQL database connection in QGIS, checking the \"Allow saving/loading QGIS projects in the database\" option. Save the project to the configured database in QGIS using Project \u2192 Save To \u2192 PostgreSQL. Add a qgisprojects service definition for the used database to qwc-docker/pg_service.conf . Write a theme configuration entry in themesConfig.json using with \"url\": \"/ows/pg/<schema>/<projectname>\" , where schema and projectname as as specified when saving the project in QGIS. Using the QGZ project file format \u00b6 You can configure qwc-docker to look for qgz project files instead of qgs project files as follows: Set qgis_project_extension to .qgz in the toplevel config section of tenantConfig.json . If using qwc-docker , set QGIS_PROJECT_SUFFIX=qgz in the qwc-qgis-server environment in docker-compose.yml . Split categorized layers \u00b6 When using qwc-docker , the qwc-config-generator has the ability to split a layer that has been classified with QGIS into multiple layers and move them into a new group (the group name will be the original layer name). To activate this functionality, follow these steps: Place the projects whose layers you want to split below qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/qgis_projects . In the topolevel config in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/tenantConfig.json , ensure qgis_projects_gen_base_dir is set and valid, and set \"split_categorized_layers\": true . For all layers that you want to split, create the variable convert_categorized_layer and set it to true . Generate the themes configuration . The qwc-config-generator will process the projects and write the modified projects to qgis_projects_gen_base_dir . Note: Make sure you are using qwc-config-generator:v<version> and not qwc-config-generator:v<version>-noqgis .","title":"Themes"},{"location":"configuration/ThemesConfiguration/#themes-configuration","text":"A theme corresponds to a QGIS project, published as WMS and served by QGIS Server.

First of all, it is important to keep in mind that the QWC2 Viewer is designed to be a modular and highly customizeable application. Configuration falls into three categories: Load-time configuration : configuration applied when the application is loaded. Customizing the assets : specify additional search providers, customize the color schemes, etc... Compiling a custom viewer : configure which components which are built into the application, add own plugins, etc... The qwc2-demo-app (and the qwc-map-viewer-demo docker image) serve as a good starting point, and for simple viewers the load-time configuration options are often sufficient to avoid the need of building a customized application. Load-time configuration config.json \u00b6 The load-time configuration config.json configuration file contains global viewer settings as well as the viewer plugin configuration for mobile and desktop devices. It is located as follows: qwc-docker : qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tentant>/config.json Standalone viewer: qwc2-app/static/config.json Refer to the sample config.json for a concrete example. Global settings \u00b6 All settings are optional, with fallback to the default values as documented. Setting Description assetsPath Relative path to the assets folder. Default value: assets . translationsPath Relative path to the translations folder. Default value: translations . loadTranslationOverrides Whether to attempt to load tanslation overrides, see translations .

Default value: see qwc2/utils/FeatureStyles.js . projections A list of map projections to register, in the format {\"code\": \"<code>\", \"proj\": \"<proj4def>\", \"label\": \"<label>\"} . By default, EPSG:3857 and EPSG:4326 are registered. allowFractionalZoom Whether to allow arbitrary scales for viewing the map. Default value: false . localeAwareNumbers Whether to use locale aware numbers throughout. Default value: false . wmsHidpi Whether to honour the device pixel ratio for WMS GetMap requests. Default value: true . wmsMaxGetUrlLength URL length limit before switching to a POST request for GetMap and GetFeatureInfo. Default: 2048. qgisServerVersion The QGIS Server major version in use, defaults to 3 . defaultColorScheme The color scheme to use. See Color schemes for details. startupTask Task to automatically aktivate on application start, in the format {key: \"<Task>\", \"mode\": \"<Mode>\"} . storeAllLayersInPermalink Whether to store the full layertree in the permalink data, rather than only local (i.e. redlining) layers. If false , remote layers are re-queried from the respective services, if true , they are statically reloaded (meaning restored layers may be outdated compared to current service capabilities). urlRegEx A JSON-escaped regular expression used to match URLs in feature attribute values. Default: see qwc2/utils/MiscUtils.js . trustWmsCapabilityURLs Whether to trust the GetMap etc. URLs reported in WMS service capabilities.

Entries must be strings or objects of the format {\"label\": \"<Label>\", \"value\": \"<URL>\"} . identifyTool The name of the identify plugin to use as default identify tool. If set to an empty string, no identify tool will be active by default. Default value: Identify . globallyDisableDockableDialogs Whether to globally disable the dockable feature of popup dialogs. Default value: false . globallyDisableMaximizeableDialogs Whether to globally disable the maximizeable feature of popup dialogs. Default value: false . searchFilterRegions List of predefined search filter regions, see Search filtering . startupTask Task to automatically start when switching to the theme, in the format {key: \"<Task>\", \"mode\": \"<Mode>\"} . Takes precedence over the global startupTask . Note that the task whenever switching to the theme, not only on application start. Note: The layer tree supports re-ordering layers via drag-and-drop if allowReorderingLayers = true and either preventSplittingGroupsWhenReordering = true or flattenLayerTreeGroups = true . If preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = true , the current extent is preserved if it is within the new theme extent and if the current theme map projection is equal to the new theme projection. If preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = \"force\" , the current extent is preserved regardless of whether it is within the new theme extent, but the current and new theme map projections must still match. Separate mobile / desktop global settings \u00b6 You can specify the global settings separately for mobile and desktop by setting these in a corresponding toplevel section, i.e.: { \"<prop>\": \"<value>\", // This property applies for both mobile and desktop ... \"mobile\": { \"<prop>: \"<value>\", // This property applies only for mobile ... }, \"desktop\": { \"<prop>: \"<value>\", // This property applies only for desktop ... } } You can also specify separate mobile and desktop sections in the config block of a theme item. URLs of external services \u00b6 Some plugins require external services (typically part of the qwc-services ecosystem). When using the qwc-docker , these configuration entries will be automatically injected into the config.json for enabled services. Setting Description authServiceUrl Typically the URL of a QWC authentication service like qwc-db-auth . editServiceUrl Typically the URL of the qwc-data-service . elevationServiceUrl Typically the URL of the qwc-elevation-service . mapInfoService Typically the URL of the qwc-map-info-service . permalinkServiceUrl Typically the URL of the qwc-permalink-service . searchServiceUrl Typically the URL of the qwc-fulltext-search-service . featureReportService Typically the URL of the qwc-document-service . Plugin configuration \u00b6 The plugin configuration is entered as follows: \"plugins\": { \"common\": [{<PluginConfig>}, ...], \"mobile\": [{<PluginConfig>}, ...], \"desktop\": [{<PluginConfig>}, ...] } The final mobile and desktop configurations will be computed by merging the common configuration with the respective specific configuration. Each <PluginConfig> block is of the format Setting Description { \u2063 \"name\": \"<name>\", The plugin name. \u2063 \"cfg\": {...}, The plugin configuration options, see plugin reference . \u2063 \"mapClickAction\": <\"identify\"|\"unset\"|null>, Optional: in case the plugin activates a viewer task, determines whether a click in the map will result in the identify tool being invoked, the task being unset, or whether no particular action should be performed (default). } A particularly interesting aspect is the configuration of the entries in the application menu and toolbar, i.e. the entries in menuItems and toolbarItems in the TopBar plugin configuration. The format of these entries is as follows: Setting Description { \u2063 \"key\": \"<key>\", The name of a plugin, i.e. LayerTree . The label for the entry will be looked up from the translations using the appmenu.items.<key> message identifier (see Managing translations ). \u2063 \"icon\": \"<icon>\", The icon of the entry, either a built-in icon name (see below), or :/<path_to_asset> containing the path relative to assetsPath of an asset image. \u2063 \"themeBlacklist\": [\"<themename>\", ...], Optional, allows specifying a blacklist of theme names or titles for which the entry should not be visible. \u2063 \"themeWhitelist\": [\"<themename>\", ...], Optional, allows specifying a whitelist of theme names or titles for which the entry should be visible. \u2063 \"mode\": \"<mode>\", Optional, depending on the plugin, a mode can be configured to launch the plugin directly in a specific mode. For instance, the Measure plugin supports specifying the measurement mode ( Point , LineString , Polygon ). \u2063 \"requireAuth\": \"<true|false>\", Optional, the entry is only visible when user is logged-in. \u2063 \"shortcut\": \"<shortcut>\" Optional, keyboard shortcut which triggers the entry, i.e. \"alt+shift+a\" . } Note: The built-in icons are those located in qwc2-app/qwc2/icons and in qwc2-app/icons . The built-in icon names are the respective file names, without .svg extension. Opening external websites As a special case, entries for opening external URLs can be defined as follows: Setting Description { \u2063 \"key\": \"<key>\", An arbitrary key (not used by existing plugins), used to lookup the label for the entry from the translations. \u2063 \"icon\": \"<icon>\", As above. \u2063 \"url\": \"<url>\", The URL to open. Can contain as placeholders the keys listed in URL Parameters , encolsed in $ (i.e. $e$ for the extent). In addition, the placeholders $x$ and $y$ for the individual map center coordinates are also supported. \u2063 \"target\": \"<target>\" The target where to open the URL, if empty, _blank is assumed. Can be iframe to open the link in a iframe window inside QWC2. } In general, the procedure for enabling a plugin is: Make sure the plugin is compiled into the application (see Build-time configuration ). In the plugins section of config.json , below common (or mobile and/or desktop ), add an entry { \"name\": \"<Plugin name>\", \"cfg\": { <Plugin configuration props> } } For most plugins (i.e. those which launch as an explicit task in the viewer), add entries in menuItems and/or toolbarItems as desired, i.e. \"menuItems\": [ ... {\"key\": \"<Plugin name>\", \"icon\": \"<icon name>\", ...} ] Customizing the viewer assets \u00b6 The viewer assets are located as follows: Standalone viewer: qwc2-app/static/assets qwc-docker : qwc-docker/volumes/qwc2/assets The default structure of the assets folder is as follows: Path Description \u2514\u2500 assets/ See Viewer assets \u251c\u2500 css/ Additional style sheets, must be included by index.html . \u2502 \u251c\u2500 colorschemes.css Additional color schemes. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 qwc2.css Additional style definitions. \u251c\u2500 img/ Application logo etc. \u2502 \u251c\u2500 genmapthumbs/ Autogenerated map thumbnails. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 mapthumbs/ Map thumbnails. \u251c\u2500 templates/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 legendprint.html HTML template for the legend print. \u251c\u2500 help.html Help dialog fragment, see Help dialog . \u2514\u2500 searchProviders.js Additional search providers, see Search providers . Furthermore, the application entry point index.html is located as follows: Standalone viewer: qwc2-app/index.html qwc-docker : qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/index.html This file noteably specifies the application title, and references many of the assets located below the assets folder. Customizing the color scheme \u00b6 The QWC2 color scheme is fully customizeable via CSS. A default color-scheme is built-in (see DefaultColorScheme.css ). To define a custom color scheme, copy the default color scheme to assets/css/colorschemes.css , add an appropriate class name to the :root selector, and modify the colors as desided. Two additional examples ( highcontrast and dark ) are provided by default in assets/css/colorschemes.css . You can then modify the color scheme which is applied by default by setting defaultColorScheme in config.json to an appropriate class name (i.e. highcontrast or dark ). To change the color scheme at runtime in QWC2, make sure the Settings plugin is enabled, and in the Settings plugin configuration block in config.json list the color schemes below colorSchemes . Refer to the sample config.json . Note : When changing the color scheme via Settings dialog in QWC2, the picked color scheme is stored in the browser local storage, and this setting will override the defaultColorScheme setting from config.json . Specifying the style URL-parameter (see URL parameters ) will take precedence over all other settings. Note: Make sure that assets/css/colorschemes.css is included in index.html . Overriding component styles \u00b6 Occasionally, it may be desired to customize the styling on the QWC2 components. The recommended approach is to add the corresponding style overrides to assets/css/qwc2.css . Note: Make sure that assets/css/qwc2.css is included in index.html . Customizing the application logo \u00b6 The application logo in its various shapes and sizes are located below assets/img/ . In particular, the logo.svg and logo-mobile.svg images are displayed as in the top left corner of QWC2 in desktop and mobile mode respectively. If you'd like to use another format than SVG (while keeping logo and logo-mobile as base name), you can change logoFormat in the TopBar configuration block in config.json . Providing custom map thumbnails \u00b6 By default, when generating the themes configuration (see [ThemesConfiguration.md#generating-theme-configuration]), a default map thumbnail is generating via WMS GetMap , and placed below assets/img/genmapthumbs . You can provide your own thumbnail images instead by placing the corresponding images below assets/img/mapthumbs and referencing these as thumbnail in you theme configuration block in themesConig.json . Personalizing the help dialog \u00b6 You can personalize the help dialog by providing a plain HTML document fragment in static/assets/help.html and configuring the Help plugin accordingly in config.json : { \"name\": \"Help\", \"cfg\": { \"bodyContentsFragmentUrl\": \"assets/help.html\" } } Note: $VERSION$ can be used in the HTML document fragment as a placeholder for the application build date. Personalizing the legend print template \u00b6 The legend print template assets/templates/legendprint.html is used when printing the map legend from the layer tree. The only requirement for this template is that is must contain a <div id=\"legendcontainer\"></div> element. Building a custom viewer \u00b6 QWC2 is divided into two repositories: The QWC2 components, hosted at https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/ . This repository contains the core building blocks common to all QWC2 applications. The QWC2 application, the demo application is hosted at https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app . To build a custom viewer, the first step is cloning the demo application: git clone --recursive https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app.git qwc2-app The typical layout of a QWC2 app source tree is as follows: Path Description \u251c\u2500 static/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 assets/ See Viewer assets \u2502 \u251c\u2500 translations/ Translation files. \u2502 \u251c\u2500 config.json Master configuration file. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 themes.json Full theme configuration, autogenerated from themesConfig.json . \u251c\u2500 js/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 app.jsx Entry point of the ReactJS application. \u2502 \u251c\u2500 appConfig.js Configuration of the qwc2 core modules. \u2502 \u251c\u2500 Help.jsx Built-in component of custom Help dialog, see Help dialog . \u2502 \u2514\u2500 SearchProviders.js Built-in custom search providers, see Search providers . \u251c\u2500 icons/ Application icons. \u251c\u2500 qwc2/ Git submodule containing the core qwc2 components. \u251c\u2500 index.html Entry point. \u251c\u2500 package.json NodeJS configuration file. \u251c\u2500 themesConfig.json Themes configuration. \u2514\u2500 webpack.config.js Webpack configuration. Application build-time configuration \u00b6 The js/appConfig.js is the the principal build-time configuation file, and defines: - The default application locale, built into the application. This locale is used if no available locale matches the browser locale. - Which plugins are built into the application. Plugins left out here will be completely omitted when compiling the application bundle, and will hence also reduce the size of the bundle. - Various hook functions, as documented in the sample sample js/appConfig.js . Refer to the sample appConfig.js for a concrete example. Overriding icons \u00b6 The common application icons are located in qwc2/icons . They can be overridden by creating an icon with the same filename in the application specific icons folder. Note : The icons in the icons folder are compiled into an icon font. The icons need to be black content on transparent background, and all drawings (including texts) must be converted to paths for the icons to render correctly. Compiling an application bundle \u00b6 After tweaking the source files as desired, compile a deployable application bundle for production running yarn run prod When using qwc-docker , copy the contents of the qwc2-app/prod folder to qwc-docker/volumes/qwc2 and edit the qwc-docker/docker-compose.yml to use qwc-map-viewer-base with your custom build: qwc-map-viewer: image: sourcepole/qwc-map-viewer-base:vYYYY.MM.DD environment: <<: *qwc-service-variables SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT: '/' volumes: - ./pg_service.conf:/srv/pg_service.conf:ro - ./volumes/config:/srv/qwc_service/config:ro - ./volumes/qwc2:/qwc2:ro Keeping the QWC2 application up to date \u00b6 As mentioned above, QWC2 is split into a common components repository and an application specific repository. The goal of this approach is to cleanly separate user-specific configuration and components which common components which serve as a basis for all QWC2 applications, and to make it as easy as possible to rebase the application onto the latest common QWC2 components. The recommended workflow is to keep the qwc2 folder a submodule referencing the upstream qwc2 repository . To update it, just checkout/update the desired branch: cd qwc2 git checkout master # or git checkout YYYY-lts git pull The QWC2 Upgrade Notes documents major changes, and in particular all incompatible changes between releases which require changes to the application specific code and/or configuration. Translations \u00b6 This section gives an overview of the common tasks related to the QWC2 translations. Switching language \u00b6 By default, QWC2 will attempt to load the translation matching your browser language. Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the language by adding the lang=<lang> query parameter to the application URL, i.e. lang=de-CH . The Settings furthermore allows graphically switching the language within QWC2, with the list of available languages configured via the languages plugin configuration property. Adding and modify translations \u00b6 When working inside a qwc2-app source folder, the translations can be found on two levels: At QWC2 components level, in qwc2-app/qwc2/translations . At application level, in qwc2-app/static/translations . A script will take care of merging the component translations into the application translations. This way, when updating the QWC2 submodule, new translations are automatically obtained. This script is automatically invoked on yarn start , but can also be manually invoked using yarn run tsupdate Translations are stored inside the respective translations folder as regular plain-text JSON files, named <lang>.json and can be freely edited with any text editor. The tsconfig.json files stored inside the respective translations folder contains the list of languages for which translations should be generated and a list of message IDs to include in the translation. The tsupdate script will automatically scan the code for message IDs (looking for static strings passed to LocaleUtils.tr and LocaleUtils.trmsg ), store these in tsconfig.json and automatically create resp. update the translation files. In some cases tsconfig.json will not pick up a message ID (for instance, if it is computed at runtime). In these cases, the message IDs can be added manually to the extra_strings section of the tsconfig.json . Also it may be desired to override a translation inherited from the QWC2 components at application level. To prevent tsupdate from continuously reverting the overridden translation, the respective message IDs can be added to the overrides section in the application tsconfig.json file. To add a new language, list it in qwc2-app/qwc2/translations/tsconfig.json and run yarn run tsupdate , then complete the messages taking the english translation file as reference. When adding or modifying translations at QWC2 components level, please contribute them by submitting a pull request to the upstream qwc2 repository . Selectively overriding translation strings \u00b6 Occasionally, it is desireable to selectively override specific translation strings. While one can modify the full translation file as described above, especially when using the qwc-map-viewer-demo docker image, it is easier to just selectively override the desired translation strings and leave the original file unchanged and avoid having to compile a custom viewer (or overwriting the entire file with a docker volume mount). To do this: Set loadTranslationOverrides to true in config.json . Create a <lang>_overrides.json containing just the ovverridden strings, for example en-US_overrides.json : { \"messages\": { \"appmenu\": { \"items\": { \"LayerTree\": \"Layers\" } } } } Place this file inside the translations folder of your production build. When using qwc-docker , you can place this file in qwc-docker/volumes/qwc2/translations/ and mount this file inside the container, i.e. : qwc-map-viewer: image: sourcepole/qwc-map-viewer-demo:vYYYY.MM.DD [...] volumes: - ./volumes/qwc2/translations/en-US_overrides.json:/qwc2/translations/en-US_overrides.json:ro Specifying the default fallback translation \u00b6 When no translation exists for the requested language (i.e. the current browser language), QWC2 will fall back to the default translation specified as defaultLocaleData in qwc2-app/js/appConfig.js . For the demo viewer, the default fallback translation is en-US .","title":"Viewer"},{"location":"configuration/ViewerConfiguration/#qwc2-viewer-configuration","text":"This chapter describes how to customize the QWC2 viewer.

At application level, in qwc2-app/static/translations . A script will take care of merging the component translations into the application translations. This way, when updating the QWC2 submodule, new translations are automatically obtained. This script is automatically invoked on yarn start , but can also be manually invoked using yarn run tsupdate Translations are stored inside the respective translations folder as regular plain-text JSON files, named <lang>.json and can be freely edited with any text editor. The tsconfig.json files stored inside the respective translations folder contains the list of languages for which translations should be generated and a list of message IDs to include in the translation. The tsupdate script will automatically scan the code for message IDs (looking for static strings passed to LocaleUtils.tr and LocaleUtils.trmsg ), store these in tsconfig.json and automatically create resp. update the translation files. In some cases tsconfig.json will not pick up a message ID (for instance, if it is computed at runtime). In these cases, the message IDs can be added manually to the extra_strings section of the tsconfig.json . Also it may be desired to override a translation inherited from the QWC2 components at application level. To prevent tsupdate from continuously reverting the overridden translation, the respective message IDs can be added to the overrides section in the application tsconfig.json file.

For this to work, you need to list .svg in the assets/inline loader rules in webpack.config.js : { test: /(.woff|.woff2|.png|.jpg|.gif|.svg)/, type: 'asset/inline' } Babel plugin changes The class-properties and object-rest-spread proposals have been merged to the ECMAScript standard, and the respective babel plugins in .babelrc.json need to be changed to \"plugins\": [ \"@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties\", \"@babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread\" ] Update to qwc2 submodule revision 7409372 (23.08.2023) [2023-lts \u2192 2024-lts] \u00b6 MapInfoToolTip plugin instantation change The instantation of the MapInfoToolTip in appConfig.js needs to be changed to MapInfoTooltipPlugin: MapInfoTooltipPlugin() Note the extra braces at the end. As a new feature, you can pass a list of plugins to the MapInfoTooltipPlugin . Configuration changes The window size configuration of various plugins has been uniformized to the geometry config prop (rather than occasionally windowSize before). Affected plugins are: FeatureForm , Identify , LayerCatalog , LayerTree , MapLegend . Please check the respective plugin reference for more details on the new format. Update to qwc2 submodule revision 96aaa51 (09.02.2023) [2023-lts \u2192 2024-lts] \u00b6 Config setting change Geodesic measurement mode is now configured at toplevel in config.json via geodesicMeasurements: true|false rather than below Map -> cfg -> toolsOptions -> MeasurementSupport . Update to qwc2 submodule revision 2c179d0 (23.01.2023) [2023-lts \u2192 2024-lts] \u00b6 Dependency update Most dependencies have been updated to the latest version. The following adjustments need to be performed by hand: Use createRoot in app.jsx , see the demo app.jsx . Update uuid imports in external components, examples: import {v1 as uuidv1} from 'uuid'; import {v4 as uuidv4} from 'uuid'; and then instead of uuid.v1() use uuidv1() etc. Adjust webpack.config.js from { test: /\\.mjs$/, type: 'javascript/auto' } to { test: /(.mjs|.js)$/, type: 'javascript/auto' } Update to qwc2 submodule revision fe063b6 (13.01.2023) \u00b6 Reworked search provider support The arguments and expected behaviour of the provider onSearch and getResultGeometry have changed. Please refer to the documentation chapter in the Documentation . Consult js/SearchProviders.js and static/assets/searchProviders.js for full examples. It is now possible to define search providers in a external JS file loaded at runtime rather than compiled into the application bundle. See static/assets/searchProviders.js , which is loaded by index.html . js/SearchProviders.js now only includes coordinates and nominatim as built-in search providers for the demo application. The searchProviderFactory function has been removed from js/SearchProviders.js . Instead, custom parameters to be passed to a provider can be specified directly in the theme item searchProviders entry: { key: \"<providerkey2>\", params: {...} } and read from searchParams.cfgParams in the provider onSearch function. Load Help dialog contents from HTML fragment Instead of requiring users to implement the renderHelp function in js/Help.jsx , for simple cases the users can provide a plain HTML fragment which is loaded at runtime from the assets. Consult the Documentation . Update to qwc2 submodule revision 90c613a (28.11.2022) \u00b6 Reworked color scheme support The styleConfig.js file is deprecated and won't be honoured anymore for the styling of core QWC2 components. Instead, base theme colors can be defined via CSS, refer to documentation for details. Renamed config variable The maxGetUrlLength variable in config.json has been renamed to wmsMaxGetUrlLength . Update to qwc2 submodule revision e357152 (27.06.2022) \u00b6 Reworked interface for handling 1:N relations between qwc2 and qwc-data-service The interface for reading and writing 1:n relations between the qwc2 and the qwc-data-service was reworked. If you are using the qwc-data-service, make sure to update to qwc-data-service-v2022.06.27 or later when updating to qwc2 submodule revision e357152 or later. Update to qwc2 submodule revision 76ec566 (17.06.2022) \u00b6 Refactoring of editing components The editing components have been heavily refactored internally. The changes are mostly transparent, but two points are important: The editDataset field of an editConfig entry is now mandatory. editConfig s generated by qwc-config-generator already write this field, so this applies only to manually written editConfig s for use outside of qwc-services. The changeEditingState action has been replaced by setEditContext (and clearEditContext ). This allows for storing and switching between multiple edit contexts in the application state. Custom components interacting with editing also should be changed to verify that the current edit context is the desired one. Update to qwc2 submodule revision 7929587 (21.04.2022) \u00b6 Format change for external layer resource strings For a short period of time (after submodule revision cb870a1 ), QWC2 supported external resource strings in the form wms:<service_url>#<layername>?<options> . The format has been changed to wms:<service_url>?<options>#<layername> i.e. by moving the query portion before the hash portion, which is inline with the URL scheme format. Update to qwc2 submodule revision eb5e358 (25.10.2021) \u00b6 Update to Webpack 5, React 17 Synchronize the webpack.config.js and the dependencies and package scripts from the demo app package.json . Note that the build package script is now an alias with the prod script. Remove the dist/App.js script include from index.html , it is now added automatically by Webpack. All static files of the app need to be placed below a toplevel static folder, which will contain assets , translations , config.json , themes.json , etc. The themesConfig script will write themes.json to that folder. In custom components, replace any use of Swipeable from react-swipeable : import {Swipeable} from 'react-swipeable'; import {Swipeable} from 'qwc2/components/Swipeable'; Update to qwc2 submodule revision e08aed5 (18.05.2021) \u00b6 Reworked Identify plugin The Identify plugin has been completely reworked, and the IdentifyRegion plugin has been merged into the Identify plugin: Remove the IdentifyRegion plugin from js/appConfig.js and config.json Create menu/toolbar entries in config.json for the region identify tool mode by specifying \"mode\": \"Region\" , i.e.: {\"key\": \"Identify\", \"icon\": \"identify_region\", \"mode\": \"Region\"}, The translation message id identifyregion.info has been changed to infotool.clickhelpPolygon (unless the string is overridden, yarn run tsupdate will take care of this automatically). Note : The identify tool state is now handled internally by the Identify component, it does not store the results in the global application state anymore. Update to qwc2 submodule revision 317eea3 (03.01.2021) \u00b6 Updated dependencies Many dependencies in the qwc2 submodule have been update, please run yarn install to update them in your application. In the demo app, also many dependencies in the application package.json have been updated. It's recommended to synchronize the application package.json and webpack.config.js with the ones of the demo app. Plugins do not need to specify the reducers they use anymore Action files register now the reducers they use automatically, so whenever a symbol is imported from an action file, the respective reducer is automatically enabled. If you have a custom action/reducer file outside the qwc2 submodule folder (i.e. js/{actions,reducers}/myfunctionality.js ), you should add lines similar to import ReducerIndex from 'qwc2/reducers/index'; import myfunctionalityReducer from '/reducers/myfunctionality'; ReducerIndex.register(\"myfunctionality\", myfunctionalityReducer); to js/actions/myfunctionality.js . If you have custom QWC2 plugins, remove the reducers field of the plugin export. ES6 imports QWC2 now uses the ES6 import/export syntax throughout. For instance const Icon = require('qwc2/components/Icon'); const {addLayer} = require('qwc2/actions/layers'); become import Icon from 'qwc2/components/Icon'; import {addLayer} from 'qwc2/actions/layers'; And module.exports = MyClass; becomes export default MyClass; resp. function foo() {...}; function bar() {...}; module.exports = {foo, bar}; becomes export function foo() {...}; export function bar() {...}; In particular, js/appConfig.js needs to be heavily adapted. Update to React 16.14 As per React 16.3, various component lifecycle methods have been deprecated. All qwc2 core components are updated to avoid their use. Custom components should also be updated. See https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html for details. Reworked localization Localization in QWC2 has been reworked: - Instead of <Message msgId=\"<msgid>\" /> and LocaleUtils.getMessageById() , use LocaleUtils.tr(<msgid>) . - For message IDs which are not translated directly via LocaleUtils.tr , use LocaleUtils.trmsg to mark the string as a message ID. - The Message component has been dropped. - Static message IDs are now picked up automatically by updateTranslations.js (invoked by yarn run tsupdate ). - Message IDs built at runtime will beed to be specified manually in tsconfig.json in the extra_strings section. - The translation files are now called translations/<lang>-<COUNTRY>.json rather than translations/data.<lang>-<COUNTRY> . The format of the files remains unchanged. - The supportedLocales section in appConfig.js needs to be dropped. - Previously, the fallback locale was specified as fallbacklocale in config.json. Now, it must be specified as defaultLocaleData in appConfig.js . Default editing interface now shipped in the qwc2 submodule The js/EditingInterface.js in the demo app has been moved to qwc2/utils/EditingInterface.js . This is the interface which acts as a counterpart to the QWC data service . If you want to use a custom editing interface, you can still do so, passing it to the Editing plugin in appConfig.js as before. Assets and translations path now optional Assets and translations path can now be omitted from the config.json , and are resolved to assets resp translations relative to the index.html path of the QWC2 application by default. Use ConfigUtils.getAssetsPath() and ConfigUtils.getTranslationsPath() in your custom components instead of ConfigUtils.getConfigProp . You can still specify assetsPath and translationsPath in config.json to override the default values. Changes to map click point/feature state The previous state.map.clickPoint and state.map.clickFeature have been merged to a single state.map.click . The clickFeatureOnMap action has been removed.","title":"QWC2 upgrade notes"},{"location":"release_notes/QWC2UpgradeNotes/#upgrade-notes","text":"This document describes incompatibilites and other aspects which QWC2 applications need to address when updating against the latest qwc2 submodule.

It supports editing both geometry and attributes, displaying customizeable attribute forms. The AttributeTable plugin also allows creating, editing and removing features of an editable vector layer. It displays all features of the editable layer in a tabularized view, and allows editing attributes, but not geometries. Noteably, it will allow editing geometryless datasets. The FeatureForm works similarly to the feature-info, but will display the feature form according to the QGIS form configuration, and also allows editing the attributes and geometry of a picked feature. It can configured as identifyTool instead of the standard Identify plugin in config.json . Quick start \u00b6 The easiest way to use the editing functionality is by using the pre-configured qwc-docker with the qwc-data-service and qwc-config-generator . To make a layer editable, follow these steps: The datasource of the layer needs to be a PostGIS database. In particular, make sure that a primary key is configured for your dataset! Configure the QGIS PostgreSQL connection using a service name, add the corresponding service definition to your host pg_service.conf and to qwc-docker/pg_service-write.conf . Make sure your database host is reachable within the docker containers! Especially when your primary key field type is serial , you'll want to mark the corresponding field widget type as Hidden in the QGIS Attributes Form settings. Create a Data resource as child of the corresponding Map resource in the administration backend, and create a new permission for the Map and Data resources for the roles which should be allowed to edit the layer. Note: if you leave the \"Write\" checkbox in the Data resource permission unchecked, the dataset will be available as read-only, which can be useful if you want to use the AttributeTable and/or FeatureForm to just display the dataset without allowing any edits. Run the config generator from the administration backend to update service configuration. Designing the edit forms \u00b6 Much of the power of the QWC2 editing functionality resides in its fully customizeable forms, providing support for different input widget types, file uploads and 1:N relations. The qwc-config-generator will automatically generate forms based on the configuration specified in the QGIS Layer Properties \u2192 Attributes Form. If Autogenerate or Drag and Drop Designer is chosen, a corresponding Qt UI form is automatically generated for QWC2 in assets/forms/autogen . If Provide ui-file is chosen, the specified UI form will copied to assets/forms/autogen . Localized translation forms are supported. To this end, place a Qt Translation file called <form_basename>_<lang>.ts next to the designer form <form_basename>.ui , where lang is a language or language/country code, i.e. en or en-US . There is a translateui.sh script to help generate the translation files. Example: ./translateui.sh .../qwc2/assets/forms/form.ui de it fr File uploads \u00b6 You can configure a text-like field of your dataset as an upload field as follows: For Autogenerated and Drag and Drop Designer forms configuration, set the widget type to Attachment. You can set the file type filter in the widget configuration under Display button to open file dialog -> Filter , in the format *.ext1, *.ext2 . For manually created Qt Designed Ui forms, use a QLineEdit widget named <fieldname>__upload , and optionally as the text value of the QLineEdit set a comma separated list of suggested file extensions. Attachments are stored on disk below the attachments_base_dir defined in the data service configuration, and the path to the attachments stored in the dataset. Note: If you set the format constraint to *.jpeg and your browser has access to a camera, QWC2 will allow you to directly upload images captured from the camera. You can set the allowed attachment extensions and maximum file sizes globally by setting allowed_attachment_extensions and max_attachment_file_size in the data service configuration. You may also need to set/increase client_max_body_size in qwc-docker/api-gateway/nginx.conf . You can also set the allowed attachment extensions and maximum file sizes per dataset by setting max_attachment_file_size_per_dataset and allowed_extensions_per_dataset in the data service configuration. If you set the per dataset values, the global settings will be disregarded (i.e. if an attachment satisfies the per dataset constraint it will be considered valid, even if it violates the global constraint). To ensure the uploaded files are properly rendered as download links in GetFeatureInfo responses, use the qwc-feature-info-service . Key-value relations (value mappings) \u00b6 Value relations allow mapping technical values to a human readable display strings, displayed in a combo box. For Autogenerated and Drag and Drop Designer , use widgets of type Value Relation . In a manually created Qt-Designer Ui form, you can use key-value relations for combo box entries by naming the QComboBox widget according to the following pattern: kvrel__<fieldname>__<kvtablename>__<kvtable_valuefield>__<kvtable_labelfield> . <kvtablename> refers to a table containing a field called <kvtable_valuefield> for the value of the entry and a field <kvtable_labelfield> for the label of the entry. For key-value relations inside a 1:N relation, use kvrel__<reltablename>__<fieldname>__<kvtablename>__<kvtable_valuefield>__<kvtable_labelfield> . Note: The relation table needs to be added as a (geometryless) table to the QGIS Project. You also need to set appropriate permissions for the relation table dataset in the QWC admin backend. Alternatively, you can set autogen_keyvaltable_datasets to true in the config generator configuration, to automatically generate resources and read-only permissions as required. 1:N relations \u00b6 1:N relations allow associating multiple child records to the target feature, displayed in a table. For Autogenerated and Drag and Drop Designer forms, configure the 1:N relation in QGIS Project \u2192 Properties \u2192 Relations. Note that the child table foreign key must refer to parent primary key. By default, a table widget similar to an attribute table will be generated to manage the relation values. If you set generate_nested_nrel_forms to true in the config generator config, the relation values will be displayed as a list of buttons which open the record in a nested form. The button label is chosen according to the following rules: The display name (Layer properties \u2192 Display \u2192 Display Name) of the referencing layer, if the expression is a single field name. The primary key value of the referencing layer. In a manually created Qt-Designer Ui form, create a widget of type QWidget , QGroupBox or QFrame named according to the pattern nrel__<reltablename>__<foreignkeyfield> , where <reltablename> is the name of the relation table and <foreignkeyfield> the name of the foreign key field in the relation table. Inside this widget, add the edit widgets for the values of the relation table. Name the widgets <reltablename>__<fieldname> . These edit widgets will be replicated for each relation record. Notes : In a manually created Qt-Designer Ui form, you can also specify a sort column for the 1:N relation in the form nrel__<reltablename>__<foreignkeyfield>__<sortcol> . If a sort-column is specified, QWC2 will display sort arrows for each entry in the relation widget. The relation table needs to be added as a (geometryless) table to the QGIS Project. You also need to set appropriate permissions for the relation table dataset in the QWC admin backend. Special form widgets \u00b6 In manually created Qt-Designer Ui forms, there are a number of special widgets you can use: Images : To display attribute values which contain an image URL as an inline image, use a QLabel named img__<fieldname> . Linked features : To display a button to choose a linked feature and edit its attributes in a nested edit form, create a QPushButton named featurelink__<linkdataset>__<fieldname> (simple join) or featurelink__<linkdataset>__<reltable>__<fieldname> in a 1:N relation. In a 1:N relation, linkdataset can be equal to reltable to edit the relation record itself in the nested form. fieldname will contain the id of the linked feature. External fields : Some times it is useful to display information from an external source in the edit form. This can be accomplished by creating a QWidget with name ext__<fieldname> and using a form preprocessor hook (see registerFormPreprocessor in QtDesignerForm.jsx to populate the field by assigning a React fragment to formData.externalFields.<fieldname> . Buttons : To add a button with a custom action, add a QPushButton with name btn__<buttonname> , and use a form preprocessor hook to set the custom function to formData.buttons.buttonname.onClick . Logging mutations \u00b6 The qwc-data-service offers some basic functionality for logging mutations: If you set upload_user_field_suffix in the data service config, the username of the last user who performed a mutation to <fieldname> will be logged to <fieldname>__<upload_user_field_suffix> . If you set edit_user_field in the data service config, the username of the last user who performed a mutation to a record with be logged to the <edit_user_field> field of the record. If you set edit_timestamp_field in the data service config, the timestamp of the last mutation to a record will be logged to the <edit_timestamp_field> field of the record. Note : for these fields to be written, ensure the qgis project is also up-to-date, i.e. that contain the up-to-date table schemas. You can set the respective field types to hidden in the QGIS layer properties to avoid them showing up in the autogenerated edit forms. Using a custom editing backend \u00b6 You can also use a custom editing backend instead of the qwc-data-service by following these steps: Implement the custom editing interface, taking default EditingInterface.js as a template. Enable the desired editing plugins in js/appConfig.js , passing your custom editing interface to Editing , AttributeTable and FeatureForm . Set up an editing backend. If you are using the qwc-config-generator , the edit configuration will be automatically generated from the QGIS project. Otherwise, you need to write a custom editConfig in themesConfig.json as follows: Entry Description { \u2063 <LayerId>: { A WMS layer ID. Should be a theme WMS layer name, to ensure the WMS is correctly refreshed. \u2063 \"layerName\": \"<LayerName>\", The layer name to show in the selection combo box. \u2063 \"editDataset\": \"<DatasetName>\", The name of the edit dataset passed to the editing interface. \u2063 \"geomType\": \"<GeomType>\", The geometry type, either Point , LineString or Polygon . \u2063 \"displayField\": \"<FieldId>\", The ID of the field to use in the feature selection menu. \u2063 \"permissions\": { A list of different write permissions to specify rights and buttons. \u2063 \"creatable\": <boolean>, If true , Draw button will appear in Editing interface and Add button in Attribute Table. \u2063 \"updatable\": <boolean>, If true , Pick button will appear in Editing interface. \u2063 \"deletable\": <boolean>, If true , Delete button will appear in Editing interface and Attribute Table. \u2063 }, \u2063 \"fields\": [{ A list of field definitions, for each exposed attribute. \u2063 \"id\": \"<FieldID>\", The field ID. \u2063 \"name\": \"<FieldName>\", The field name, as displayed in the editing form. \u2063 \"type\": \"<FieldType>\", A field type. Either bool , list or a regular HTML input element type . \u2063 \"constraints\": { Constraints for the input field. \u2063 \"values\": [<Entries>], Only if type is list : an array of arbitrary strings. \u2063 ... For regular HTML input types, the ReactJS API name of any applicable HTML input constraint , i.e. maxLength or readOnly . \u2063 } \u2063 }], \u2063 \"form\": \"<PathToUiFile>\", Optional, a QtDesigner UI file. \u2063 } } If you specify just fields , a simple form is autogenerated based on the field definitions.

The feature info is by default triggered when clicking on a feature in the map. You can also configure the feature info as an explicit viewer tool by setting identifyTool: null and adding a menuItems or toolbarItems entry. The following approaches are available for feature info: Identify plugin: WMS GetFeatureInfo , rendered in a table or in a custom HTML template DB feature info with custom SQL queries FeatureForm plugin : custom attribute forms with qwc-data-service WMS GetFeatureInfo \u00b6 To query features over WMS GetFeatureInfo, set identifyTool: \"Identify\" . By default, results are displayed in a table. To display the results in a custom HTML template, the qwc-feature-info-service can be used . Note: Use of the qwc-feature-info-service is also recommended if the qwc-data-service is used for editing, to ensure attribute values containing paths to uploaded files are properly converted to clickable hyperlinks. Set whether a layer is identifyable in QGIS &rarr; Project Properties &rarr; Data sources . To highlight the geometry, make sure QGIS &rarr; Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Add geometry to feature response is checked. Suppressing attributes \u00b6 You can suppress attributes globally by selecting \"Do not expose via WMS\" in QGIS \u2192 Layer properties \u2192 Fields. Alternatively, you can selectively restrict attributes using the qwc-admin-gui and assigning Attribute resource permissions as desired. You can also omit empty attributes by setting skipEmptyFeatureAttributes: true in the theme configuration entry in themesConfig.json . If you use the qwc-feature-info-service , you can also omit empty attributes directly in the GetFeatureInfo by setting skip_empty_attributes: true in the featureInfo service configuration in tenantConfig.json . Attribute values: HTML markup, hyperlinks, images \u00b6 In general, HTML markup in attribute values is preserved. For displaying interactive hyperlinks, the following options are supported: URLs in attribute text values with no HTML markup are automatically converted to an interactive hyperlink. Alternatively, you can enclose the URL in a HTML <a> tag in the attribute value. To open the linked page in an inline dialog within QWC2, you can set the anchor target to :iframedialog:<dialogname>:<optkey>=<optval>:<optkey>=<optval>:... where the supported options are: w : Dialog width in pixels, default: 640 . h : Dialog height in pixels, default: 480 . title : Dialog window title, by default the translation string windows.<dialogname> . print : Whether to add a print icon for printing the dialog contents, default: true . dockable : Whether the dialog can be docked, default false . docked : Whether the dialog is initially docked, default false . Example: <a href=\"https://example.com\" target=\":iframedialog:w=1024:h=768:title=Example\">Link text</a> For displaying images, the following options are supported: If replaceImageUrls: true is set in the Identify plugin configuration in config.json , attribute text values which contain exactly an URL to an image are converted to inline images. If you use the qwc-feature-info-service , you need to set transform_image_urls in the featureInfo service configuration in tenantConfig.json . Alternatively, you can add a <img> tag directly in the attribute value. This applies in particular to <a /> anchor and <img /> tags for displaying links an images in an attribute value. Client side attribute transformations \u00b6 This functionality is only available without the qwc-feature-info-service . To compute derived attributes client-side, you can implement the customAttributeCalculator in qwc2-app/js/IdentifyExtensions.js (which is passed to the Identify plugin in appConfig.js ). To transform attributes client-side you can implement the attributeTransform in qwc2-app/js/IdentifyExtensions.js (which is passed to the Identify plugin in appConfig.js ). Custom export \u00b6 By default, the identify dialog in QWC2 allows you to export the results to json (QWC2 feature storage format), geojson (standard GeoJSON without QWC2 specific fields), csv (single CSV with all layers) or csv+zip (ZIP with one CSV per layer). You can define additional export functions by extending customExporters in qwc2-app/js/IdentifyExtensions.js . Custom HTML templates \u00b6 You can specify a custom HTML template for displaying the feature rather than the default table view by using the qwc-feature-info-service and providing the template in the featureInfo service configuration in tenantConfig.json , either inline or as a path: { \"name\": \"featureInfo\", \"config\": ..., \"resources\": { \"wms_services\": [ { \"name\": \"<service_name>\", \"root_layer\": { \"name\": \"<root_layer_name>\", \"layers\": [ { \"name\": \"<layer_name>\", \"info_template\": { <See below> } } ] } } ] } } Example info_template with inline template: \"info_template\": { \"type\": \"wms\", \"template\": \"<div><h2>Demo Template</h2>Pos: {{ x }}, {{ y }}<br>Name: {{ feature.Name }}</div>\" } Example info_template with template path: \"info_template\": { \"type\": \"wms\", \"template_path\": \"/info_templates/template.html\" } Note: - x and y are the info query coordinates. feature.<attr> renders the attr attribute value of the feature. - The templates must be HTML fragments without html or body tags. - The templates folder needs to be mounted into the qwc-feature-info-service container, i.e.: qwc-feature-info-service: image: sourcepole/qwc-feature-info-service:vYYYY.MM.DD volumes: ... - ./volumes/info-templates:/info_templates:ro DB query feature info \u00b6 When using the Identify plugin and the qwc-feature-info-service , you can query features directly from a database instead of over WMS GetFeatureInfo, by providing the featureInfo service configuration as described in HTML templates , but specifying a db_url and sql , for example \"info_template\": { \"type\": \"sql\", \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_geodb\", \"sql\": \"SELECT ogc_fid as _fid_, name, formal_en, pop_est, subregion, ST_AsText(wkb_geometry) as wkt_geom FROM qwc_geodb.ne_10m_admin_0_countries WHERE ST_Intersects(wkb_geometry, ST_GeomFromText(:geom, :srid)) LIMIT :feature_count;\", \"template\": \"<div><h2>Demo Template</h2>Pos: {{ x }}, {{ y }}<br>Name: {{ feature.Name }}</div>\" } Note: x , y and geom are passed as parameters to the SQL query. If a GetFeatureInfo request is being processed with a filter_geom parameter, geom will correspond to that parameter. Otherwise geom will be POINT(x y) . Localization \u00b6 The qwc-feature-info-service supports switching the runtime locale by setting the LOCALE environment variable, i.e.: qwc-feature-info-service: image: docker.io/sourcepole/qwc-feature-info-service:latest-lts environment: <<: *qwc-service-variables SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT: '/api/v1/featureinfo' LOCALE: 'de_DE' In addition, the locale object is available in templates. This is particularly helpful for rendering locale-formatted numbers, i.e. <div>Area: {{ locale.format_string(\"%.2f\", area, True) }}</div> Feature form \u00b6 The FeatureForm plugin displays picked features in a feature form as configured in QGIS &rarr; Layer properties &rarr; Attributes form . It queries the features via qwc-data-service , and hence only works for layers with postgresql data source. See Designing the edit forms for more information on designing edit forms. To use it as default identify-tool, set identifyTool: \"FeatureForm\" in config.json . A layer is only identifyable with the FeatureForm plugin if corresponding Data resources and permissions are configured for the layer data source in the qwc-admin-gui . If a write permission is configured, the feature will be editable. Permissions \u00b6 When using the Identify plugin and the qwc-feature-info-service , you can manage the permissions in the qwc-admin-gui as follows: To restrict the display of single layer attributes to specific roles, create a Layer and Attribute resource (latter as child of the created Layer resource) and create permissions assigning the desired roles to the Attribute resources. Note : The name of the Attribute resource needs to be equal to the attribute alias name if one is defined in the QGIS project! To restrict whether a layer is identifiable to specific roles, create a FeatureInfo service and FeatureInfo layer resource (latter as child of the created FeatureInfo service resource), and create permissions assigning the desired roles to the FeatureInfo layer resources.

To configure additional tenants, the main steps are as follows: Define how the tenant name is extracted from the requests. Write a tenantConfig.json , specifying the location of the configuration database, the viewer configuration and viewer assets. Extracting the tenant name from the requests \u00b6 Multi-tenancy works by extracting a tenant name from the request URL and passing it to the respective QWC services. A typical setup is to run the application at the base address https://<hostname>/<tenant>/ The simplest approach is to extract the tenant name in a rewrite rule and set a corresponding header which will be read by the QWC services.

There are a number of configuration options which specifically affect the type of multi-tenancy setup, which is very flexible. Possible choices are: Shared vs. separate configuration database / admin backend Shared vs. separate viewer build Shared vs. separate qgs-resources tree etc... In general, you need to ensure that All the service URLs point to locations which are handled by the api-gateway configuration. All the paths refers to locations which are mounted in qwc-docker/docker-compose.yml . All database connection service names refer to connections which are defined qwc-docker/pg_service.conf . A minimal configuration for tenant tenant_name may look as follows: { \"$schema\": \"https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator/raw/master/schemas/qwc-config-generator.json\", \"service\": \"config-generator\", \"config\": { \"tenant\": \"tenant_name\", \"default_qgis_server_url\": \"http://qwc-qgis-server/ows/\", \"config_db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgis_projects_base_dir\": \"/data/tenant_name\", \"qgis_projects_scan_base_dir\": \"/data/tenant_name/scan\", \"qwc2_base_dir\": \"/qwc2\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/tenant_name/ows\", ... }, \"themesConfig\": \"./themesConfig.json\", \"services\": [ { \"name\": \"adminGui\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgs_resources_path\": \"/qgs-resources/tenant_name/\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/tenant_name/ows\", ... } }, { \"name\": \"dbAuth\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"config_generator_service_url\": \"http://qwc-config-service:9090\" } }, { \"name\": \"mapViewer\", \"generator_config\": { \"qwc2_config\": { \"qwc2_config_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/tenant_name/config.json\", \"qwc2_index_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/tenant_name/index.html\" } }, \"config\": { \"qwc2_path\": \"/qwc2/\", \"auth_service_url\": \"/tenant_name/auth/\", \"ogc_service_url\": \"/tenant_name/ows/\", \"info_service_url\": \"/tenant_name/api/v1/featureinfo/\", ... } } ] } Notes : The database URL ( postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb ) will determine whether a shared or sperate configuration database is used for each tenant. The qwc2_config_file , qwc2_index_file , qwc2_base_dir and qwc2_path paths will determine whether the viewer build/configuration is shared or separate for each tenant. To use a separate assets folder for each tenant, you can set an appropriate assetsPath in the qwc2_config_file of each tenant. The various service URLs in the mapViewer configuration and in other service configurations need to match what is expected in the api-gateway configuration. tenantConfig template \u00b6 In particular when managing a large number of tenants, it can be tedious and error-prone to manage separate tenantConfig.json files for each tenant which might be nearly identical aside from the tenant name. To alleviate this, you can create a tenantConfig template, using the $tenant$ placeholder where appropriate, and point to this file in the respective tenantConfig.json files. The contents of the template will then be merged with the contents of tenantConfig.json , and occurence of $tenant$ in the template will be replaced with the current tenant name. For example, a minimal tenantConfig.json in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/tenant_name/ could look as follows: { \"template\": \"../tenantConfig.template.json\", \"config\": { \"tenant\": \"tenant_name\" }, \"themesConfig\": \"./themesConfig.json\" } And the tenantConfig.template.json in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/ as follows: { \"$schema\": \"https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator/raw/master/schemas/qwc-config-generator.json\", \"service\": \"config-generator\", \"config\": { \"default_qgis_server_url\": \"http://qwc-qgis-server/ows/\", \"config_db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgis_projects_base_dir\": \"/data\", \"qgis_projects_scan_base_dir\": \"/data/$tenant$/scan\", \"qwc2_base_dir\": \"/qwc2\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/ows\", ... }, \"themesConfig\": \"./themesConfig.json\", \"services\": [ { \"name\": \"adminGui\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgs_resources_path\": \"/qgs-resources/\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/ows\", ... } }, { \"name\": \"dbAuth\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"config_generator_service_url\": \"http://qwc-config-service:9090\" } }, { \"name\": \"mapViewer\", \"generator_config\": { \"qwc2_config\": { \"qwc2_config_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/$tenant$/config.json\", \"qwc2_index_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/$tenant$/index.html\" } }, \"config\": { \"qwc2_path\": \"/qwc2/\", \"auth_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/auth/\", \"ogc_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/ows/\", \"info_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/api/v1/featureinfo/\", ... } } ] }","title":"Multi-tenancy"},{"location":"topics/MultiTenancy/#multi-tenancy","text":"Multi-tenancy allows serving multiple viewer configurations from a single installation.

For example server { listen 80; server_name localhost; proxy_redirect off; server_tokens off; location ~ ^/(?<t>tenant1|tenant2) { # Extract tenant proxy_set_header Tenant $t; # Set headers for original request host proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; location ~ ^/[^/]+/auth { rewrite ^/[^/]+(.+) $1 break; proxy_pass http://qwc-auth-service:9090; } location ~ ^/[^/]+/ows { rewrite ^/[^/]+(.+) $1 break; proxy_pass http://qwc-ogc-service:9090; } location ~ ^/[^/]+/api/v1/featureinfo { rewrite ^/[^/]+(.+) $1 break; proxy_pass http://qwc-feature-info-service:9090; } # etc... location ~ ^/[^/]+/qwc_admin { rewrite ^/[^/]+(.+) $1 break; proxy_pass http://qwc-admin-gui:9090; } # Place these last to give precedence to the other rules: # Redirect request without trailing slash location ~ ^(/[^/]+)$ { return 301 $scheme://$http_host$1/; } location ~ ^/[^/]+/ { rewrite ^/[^/]+(.+) $1 break; proxy_pass http://qwc-map-viewer:9090; } } }","title":"Extracting the tenant name from the requests"},{"location":"topics/MultiTenancy/#writing-the-tenantconfigjson","text":"The tenant configuration file tenantConfig.json is located at qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/tenantConfig.json with <tenant> the name of the tenant. There are a number of configuration options which specifically affect the type of multi-tenancy setup, which is very flexible. Possible choices are: Shared vs. separate configuration database / admin backend Shared vs. separate viewer build Shared vs. separate qgs-resources tree etc... In general, you need to ensure that All the service URLs point to locations which are handled by the api-gateway configuration. All the paths refers to locations which are mounted in qwc-docker/docker-compose.yml . All database connection service names refer to connections which are defined qwc-docker/pg_service.conf .

The qwc2_config_file , qwc2_index_file , qwc2_base_dir and qwc2_path paths will determine whether the viewer build/configuration is shared or separate for each tenant.

To alleviate this, you can create a tenantConfig template, using the $tenant$ placeholder where appropriate, and point to this file in the respective tenantConfig.json files. The contents of the template will then be merged with the contents of tenantConfig.json , and occurence of $tenant$ in the template will be replaced with the current tenant name. For example, a minimal tenantConfig.json in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/tenant_name/ could look as follows: { \"template\": \"../tenantConfig.template.json\", \"config\": { \"tenant\": \"tenant_name\" }, \"themesConfig\": \"./themesConfig.json\" } And the tenantConfig.template.json in qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/ as follows: { \"$schema\": \"https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator/raw/master/schemas/qwc-config-generator.json\", \"service\": \"config-generator\", \"config\": { \"default_qgis_server_url\": \"http://qwc-qgis-server/ows/\", \"config_db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgis_projects_base_dir\": \"/data\", \"qgis_projects_scan_base_dir\": \"/data/$tenant$/scan\", \"qwc2_base_dir\": \"/qwc2\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/ows\", ... }, \"themesConfig\": \"./themesConfig.json\", \"services\": [ { \"name\": \"adminGui\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"qgs_resources_path\": \"/qgs-resources/\", \"ows_prefix\": \"/ows\", ... } }, { \"name\": \"dbAuth\", \"config\": { \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_configdb\", \"config_generator_service_url\": \"http://qwc-config-service:9090\" } }, { \"name\": \"mapViewer\", \"generator_config\": { \"qwc2_config\": { \"qwc2_config_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/$tenant$/config.json\", \"qwc2_index_file\": \"/srv/qwc_service/config-in/$tenant$/index.html\" } }, \"config\": { \"qwc2_path\": \"/qwc2/\", \"auth_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/auth/\", \"ogc_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/ows/\", \"info_service_url\": \"/$tenant$/api/v1/featureinfo/\", ... } } ] }","title":"tenantConfig template"},{"location":"topics/Printing/","text":"Printing \u00b6 QWC2 supports printing to PDF via the QGIS Server GetPrint request. The basic steps are: Ensure the Print plugin is enabled in the QWC2 viewer. Create print layouts in the QGIS project as desired. The layouts must contain one Map element. Generate the themes configuration . The available print layouts will then appear in the QWC2 print plugin. You can limit the available print scales by setting printScales (or defaultPrintScales ) in the theme configuration to a list of scale denominators. If the list is empty, the print scale can be freely chosen. Similarly, you can limit the available print resolutions by setting printResolutions (or defaultPrintResolutions ) in the theme configuration to a list of resolutions. If the list is empty, the print resolution can be freely chosen. External WMS layers are automatically printed if the Print plugin config option printExternalLayers is true (default). Note that printing external WMTS layers is currently not supported by the QGIS Server. You can enable the option to generate a GeoPDF by setting the Print plugin config option allowGeoPdfExport to true . Note: This is only supported on QGIS Server 3.32 and newer. You can select output format for printing layout. Default values are application/pdf , image/jpeg , image/png and image/svg . You can restrict formats to one or more of them by setting the Print plugin config option formats to an array of these formats. See QGIS Server documentation for WMS GetPrint supported formats. Some additional tasks include: Configuring the print background layers Configuring user labels Configuring the print grid Configuring layouts with legend Configuring atlas printing Configuring print background layers \u00b6 Background layers are handled purely client-side in QWC2. There are two options for printing the background layer: The first option is to add a printLayer to the background layer entry when writing the themes configuration , i.e.: { ... \"backgroundLayers\": [ {\"name\": \"<background layer name>\", \"printLayer\": \"<qgis layer name or resource string>\"} ] } You can set printLayer to a QGIS layer name, or to a resource string (i.e. wms:<baseurl>#<layername> ). A QGIS layer marked as printLayer will be filtered out from the QWC2 layer tree, and hence will not be displayed in QWC2. You can also set printLayer to a list [{\"maxScale\": <scale>, \"name\": \"<layer name>\"}, ..., {\"maxScale\": null, \"name\": \"<QGis layer name>\"}] , ordered in ascending order by maxScale . The last entry should have maxScale null , as the layer used for all remaining scales. This approach allows i.e. using a WMTS background layer in the web client for higher performance, and using a WMS background layer when printing for higher quality/resolution. The second option is to use WMS background layers, which are automatically printed as external layers. User labels \u00b6 User labels appear as free-text input fields in the QWC2 print dialog. To configure user labels, it is sufficient to add item id s to layout label items in the print layout. The specified id will appear as input field label in the QWC2 print dialog. Note : Label id s beginning with __ (two underscore characters) are ignored as user labels by QWC2. You can can customize the input field (max length, number of rows) by setting the printLabelConfig in the theme configuration . Also, in the theme configuration, you can also set: printLabelForSearchResult : The id of the label to which to write the current search result label, if any. printLabelForAttribution : The id of the label to which to write the current map attribution text, if any. If you set the Print plugin config option hideAutopopulatedFields to true , these labels will not be shown in the print dialog, otherwise they will be displayed as read-only fields. Print grid \u00b6 In alternative to configuring a grid directly in the print layout, one can also define a printGrid configuration in the theme configuration . For example \"printGrid\": { \"s\": 1000, \"x\": 500, \"y\": 500, \"s\": 2000, \"y\": 1000, \"y\": 1000, \"s\": 10000, \"y\": 5000, \"y\": 5000, } will print a 500x500 (map units) grid for scales up to 1:1000 , a 1000x1000 grid for scales up to 1:2000 , etc. Layouts with legend \u00b6 The QWC2 print dialog will expose a toggle switch to enable the legend in the print output for layout <layout_name> if the QGIS project contains a second layout named <layout_name>_legend . The layout with the _legend suffix is expected to contain a legend item. Atlas printing \u00b6 To enable atlas printing in QWC2, configure the QGIS project as follows: Check the Generate an atlas checkbox in the desired layout in QGIS layout designer \u2192 Atlas \u2192 Atlas settings, selecting the coverage layer as desired. In the layout map item properties, check Controlled by Atlas . In the Project properties \u2192 QGIS Server, set Maximum features for Atlas print requests to the desired value. QWC2 will then display a feature picked in the print dialog which will allow picking the desired atlas features, and QGIS Server will generate a multi-page PDF accordingly. Layout templates \u00b6 The QGIS Server print templates plugin allows providing a common set of print layouts to projects to avoid having to manage potentially identical print layouts multiple times in the individual projects. To configure it in qwc-docker , proceed as follows: Download the QGIS Server print templates plugin , i.e. to volumes/qgis-server-plugins/print_templates , choose a print layout folder (i.e. volumes/print-layouts ) and configure the qwc-qgis-server container as follows: qwc-qgis-server: image: docker.io/sourcepole/qwc-qgis-server:<TAG> environment: FCGID_EXTRA_ENV: 'PRINT_LAYOUT_DIR' PRINT_LAYOUT_DIR: '/layouts' volumes: - ./volumes/qgis-server-plugins/print_templates:/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/print_templates:ro - ./volumes/print-layouts:/layouts:ro ... Mount the print layout folder also into the config generator container: qwc-config-service: image: docker.io/sourcepole/qwc-config-generator:<TAG> volumes: - ./volumes/print-layouts:/layouts:ro ... Extend the config generator configuration in tenantConfig.json by specifying the location of the print layouts dir: { \"config\": { \"qgis_print_layouts_dir\": \"/layouts\" ... } ... } In a multi-tenant environment, to provide separate print layouts for each tenant, organize the layouts in separate directories for each tenant below qgis_print_layouts_dir , and specify qgis_print_layouts_tenant_subdir in the respective tenantConfig.json to point to the desired subdir path.","title":"Printing"},{"location":"topics/Printing/#printing","text":"QWC2 supports printing to PDF via the QGIS Server GetPrint request.

In addition, the qwc-fulltext-search-service provided by the qwc-services ecosystem can be used. Adding search providers \u00b6 Search providers can be defined as follows: Built-in, defined in js/SearchProviders.js . This file is structured as follows: export const SearchProviders = { <providerkey1>: <ProviderDefinition1>, <providerkey2>: <ProviderDefinition2>, ... }; Built-in search providers are compiled into the application bundle and avoid the need for an extra resource to be loaded on application startup. The downside is that you need to rebuild QWC2 to add/modify search providers. As resource, defined in static/assets/searchProviders.js . This file is structured as follows: window.QWC2SearchProviders = { <providerkey1>: <ProviderDefinition1>, <providerkey2>: <ProviderDefinition2>, ... }; This script file needs to be loaded explicitly by index.html via <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"assets/searchProviders.js\" ></script> The format of ProviderDefinition is { label: \"<human readable provider name>\", // OR labelmsgid: \"<translation message ID for human readable provider name>\", onSearch: function(searchText, searchParams, callback, axios) => { const results = []; // See below /* Populate results... */ callback({results: results}); }, getResultGeometry: function(resultItem, callback, axios) => { /* Retreive geometry... */ // resultItem is a search result entry as returned by onSearch, which provides the context for retreiving the geometry const geometry = \"<wktString>\"; // or const geometry = {<GeoJSON geometry>}; const crs = \"EPSG:XXXX\"; const hidemarker = <boolean>; // Whether to suppress displaying a search marker on top of the search geometry callback({geometry: geometry, crs: crs, hidemarker: hidemarker}); }, handlesGeomFilter: <boolean>; // Hint whether provider will completely filter the results on provider side and that no client-side filtering is necessary } Notes: The format of searchParams is { displaycrs: \"EPSG:XXXX\", // Currently selected mouse coordinate display CRS mapcrs: \"EPSG:XXXX\", // The current map CRS lang: \"<code>\", // The current application language, i.e. en-US or en cfgParams: <params> // Additional parameters passed in the theme search provider configuration, see below filterBBox: <[xmin, ym\u00een, xmax, ymax]|null> // A filter bbox, in mapcrs, the search component may pass to the provider to narrow down the results filterPoly: <[[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ....]> // A filter polygon, in mapcrs, the search component may pass to the provider to narrow down the results } axios is passed for convenience so that providers can use the compiled-in axios library for network requests. The format of the results list returned by onSearch is as follows: results = [ { id: \"<categoryid>\", // Unique category ID title: \"<display_title>\", // Text to display as group title in the search results priority: priority_nr, // Optional: search result group priority. Groups with higher priority are displayed first in the list. items: [ { // Location search result: type: SearchResultType.PLACE, // Specifies that this is a location search result id: \"<itemId\">, // Unique item ID text: \"<display text>\", // Text to display as search result label: \"<map marker text>\", // Optional, text to show next to the position marker on the map instead of `text` x: x, // X coordinate of result y: y, // Y coordinate of result crs: crs, // CRS of result coordinates and bbox bbox: [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], // Bounding box of result (if non-empty, map will zoom to this extent when selecting result) geometry: <GeoJSON geometry> // Optional, result geometry.

Filtering \u00b6 When using the SearchBox search component with allowSearchFilters: true passed in the TopBar searchOptions , you a filter menu will be displayed allowing to restrict the search area. If the provider does not fully handle the filter geometry internally ( handlesGeomFilter != true ), client-side filtering will be performed as follows: Polygon intersection test if the result has a geometry field with a Polygon geometry Polygon intersection test if the result has a bbox field Point-in-polygon test using the results x and y point coordinates You can also set a predefined list of filter areas by setting searchFilterRegions in config.json (or per-theme in themesConfig.json ) as follows: \"searchFilterRegions\": [ { \"name\": \"<Group name>\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"<Name>\", \"crs\": \"<EPSG:XXXX>\", \"coordinates\": [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ...] }, ... ] }, ... ] ``` ## Configuring theme search providers For each theme item in `themesConfig.json`, you can define a list of search providers to enable for the theme as follows: ```json ... searchProviders: [ \"<providerkey1>\", // Simple form { // Provider with custom params \"provider\": \"<providerkey2>\", \"params\": { ... // Arbitrary params passed to the provider `onSearch` function as `searchParams.cfgParams` } }, { // Fulltext search configuration using qwc-fulltext-search-service \"provider\":\"solr\", // Identifier for solr search provider \"default\":[<default terms>] // Default search terms, concatenated with additional search terms from visible theme layers } ], ... Note: The qwc2-demo-app (also used by the qwc-map-viewer-demo docker image) includes three providers by default: coordinates , nominatim (OpenStreetMap location search), and qgis (see below ). Configuring the QGIS feature search \u00b6 The QGIS feature search relies on WMS GetFeatureInfo with the FILTER parameter to search features of layers which are part of the theme WMS. It is enabled via the qgis search provider, which is part of the qwc2-demo-app . Note : Make sure the QGIS Project is configured to return geometries with the feature info responses ( Project \u2192 Properties \u2192 QGIS Server \u2192 Add geometry to feature response ). In it's simples form, you can configure the theme search provider entry as follows: { \"provider\": \"qgis\", \"params\": { \"title\": \"<search name>\", \"expression\": { \"<layername1>\": \"<expression>\", \"<layername2>\": \"<expression>\" } } } where expression is a WMS GetFeatureInfo FILTER expression, for example \"\\\"name\\\" ILIKE '%$TEXT$%'\" . $TEXT$ will be replaced by the search text entered by the user, name corresponds to a field name of the specified layer. A more complex form, useable through the FeatureSearch plugin, allows defining a field configuration for multiple input fields. A full example is as follows: { \"provider\": \"qgis\", \"params\": { \"title\": \"Person search\", \"expression\": { \"persons\": \"\\\"name\\\" ILIKE '%$NAME$%' AND \\\"age\\\" >= $AGE$ AND \\\"gender\\\" = '$GENDER$'\" }, \"fields\": { \"NAME\": {\"label\": \"Name\", \"type\": \"text\"}, \"AGE\": {\"label\": \"Min. age\", \"type\": \"number\", \"options\": {\"min\": 0}}, \"GENDER\": {\"label\": \"Gender\", \"type\": \"select\", \"options\": [{\"value\": \"f\", \"label\": \"Female\"}, {\"value\": \"m\", \"label\": \"Male\"}]} } } } Here, each field will provide a value which is substituted in the expression. Any HTML Input type is supported (i.e. text , number , range , ...), with options depending on the input type. In addition, the select field type is supported to display a ComboBox, with the entries provided as options as in the example above. It is also possible to pass a flat list as options , i.e. [\"Female\", \"Male\"] if the value is equal to the label. Note : qgis provider searches are exposed to the search field only if no fields are specified (i.e. single input search). The FeatureSearch plugin on the other hand will list all qgis provider searches. In addition to the configuration described above, you can specify these additional parameters in params : featureCount : A number, passed as feature_count to the GetFeatureInfo request to control the maximum number of returned features. If not specified, defaults to 100 . resultTitle : A format string for the result title. Allowed placeholders are: {layername} for the layer name and {<fieldname>} for the value of fieldname . If not the layer name followed by the feature displayfield will be shown. description : An arbitrary descriptive text which will be displayed above the search fields in the FeatureSearch plugin. default : Whether the search is selected by default when opening the FeatureSearch plugin. group : A group name, used to group the searches in the FeatureSearch selection combobox. Configuring the fulltext search service \u00b6 Solr configuration \u00b6 Before the fulltext search service can be configured, a new solr configuration file must be created. This file must be created in volumes/solr/configsets/gdi/conf/ . The name of the file can be chosen freely. Here is an example XML file: <dataConfig> <dataSource driver=\"org.postgresql.Driver\" url=\"jdbc:postgresql://{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}\" user=\"{DB_USER}\" password=\"{DB_PASSWORD}\" /> <document> <entity name=\"{SEARCH_NAME}\" query=\" WITH index_base AS ( /* ==== Base query for search index ==== */ SELECT '{SEARCH_NAME}'::text AS subclass, {PRIMARY_KEY} AS id_in_class, '{PRIMARY_KEY}' AS id_name, '{SEARCH_FIELD_DATA_TYPE}:n' AS id_type, {DISPLAYTEXT} AS displaytext, {SEARCH_FIELD_1} AS search_part_1, {GEOMETRY_FIELD} AS geom FROM {SCHEMA}.{SEARCH_TABLE_NAME} /* ===================================== */ ) SELECT (array_to_json(array_append(ARRAY[subclass::text], id_in_class::text)))::text AS id, displaytext AS display, search_part_1 AS search_1_stem, search_part_1 AS sort, subclass AS facet, 'default' AS tenant, (array_to_json(array_append(ARRAY[id_name::text], id_type::text)))::text AS idfield_meta, (st_asgeojson(st_envelope(geom), 0, 1)::json -> 'bbox')::text AS bbox, st_srid(geom) as srid FROM index_base\"> </entity> </document> </dataConfig> The next table shows how the values need to be defined: Name Definition Example DB_HOST Database hostname qwc-postgis DB_NAME Database name qwc_demo DB_PORT Database port number 5432 DB_USER Database username qwc_service DB_PASSWORD Password for the specified database user qwc_service SEARCH_NAME Name of the search fluesse_search PRIMARY_KEY Primary key name of the table that is used in the search query ogc_fid SEARCH_FIELD_DATA_TYPE Search field data type str DISPLAYTEXT Displaytext that will be shown by the QWC2 when a match was found name_long SEARCH_FIELD_1 Table field that will be used by the search name_long GEOMETRY_FIELD Name of the geometry column of the search table wkb_geometry SCHEMA Search table schema qwc_geodb SEARCH_TABLE_NAME Search table name fluesse Note : In the case of several searches sharing the same database connection, all searche queries can be written to the same XML file. Each search corresponds to exactly one <entity> tag in the XML file. After the configuration file has been created, the search must be registered in solr . In the volumes/solr/configsets/gdi/conf/solrconfig.xml file you have to look for <!-- SearchHandler and add the following configuration <requestHandler name=\"/SEARCH_NAME\" class=\"solr.DataImportHandler\"> <lst name=\"defaults\"> <str name=\"config\">NAME_OF_THE_CONFIGURATION_FILE.xml</str> </lst> </requestHandler> Finally, the solr index has to be generated: rm -rf volumes/solr/data/* docker compose restart qwc-solr curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gdi/SEARCH_NAME?command=full-import' Configure fulltext service \u00b6 The configuration of the fulltext search service can be found in tenantConfig.json . Search the services list for the JSON object that has search as its name. Then add a new facet to the facets list. An example entry could be: { \"name\": \"search\", \"config\": { \"solr_service_url\": \"http://qwc-solr:8983/solr/gdi/select\", \"search_result_limit\": 50, \"db_url\": \"postgresql:///?service=qwc_geodb\" }, \"resources\": { \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"SEARCH_NAME\", \"filter_word\": \"OPTIONAL_SEARCH_FILTER\", \"table_name\": \"SCHEMA.SEARCH_TABLE_NAME\", \"geometry_column\": \"GEOMETRY_FIELD\", \"search_id_col\": \"PRIMARY_KEY\" } ] } } The filter_word field can be specified to activate / deactivate searches, if you have configure multiple searches for one theme. Normally filter_word is left empty ( \"\" ) which results in the search always being active. But if specified (e.g. \"house_no\" ) then the fulltext search will only use the configured search, if the user prefixes his search text with \"house_no:\" . Activate search for a theme \u00b6 As a final step, you have to configure the search for the desired themes and give the users the necessary rights in the Admin GUI. Add the following to a theme item in themesConfig.json : \"searchProviders\": [ { \"provider\": \"solr\", \"default\": [<SEARCH_NAME>], \"layers\": { \"<layer_name>\": \"<SEARCH_NAME>\" } } ] When activating a search to a theme, you can either: Add the search name to the default list, resulting in the search always being active. Add the search name to the layers object, resulting in the search being active only if the theme layer <layer_name> is present in the theme.

It is enabled via the qgis search provider, which is part of the qwc2-demo-app . Note : Make sure the QGIS Project is configured to return geometries with the feature info responses ( Project \u2192 Properties \u2192 QGIS Server \u2192 Add geometry to feature response ). In it's simples form, you can configure the theme search provider entry as follows: { \"provider\": \"qgis\", \"params\": { \"title\": \"<search name>\", \"expression\": { \"<layername1>\": \"<expression>\", \"<layername2>\": \"<expression>\" } } } where expression is a WMS GetFeatureInfo FILTER expression, for example \"\\\"name\\\" ILIKE '%$TEXT$%'\" . $TEXT$ will be replaced by the search text entered by the user, name corresponds to a field name of the specified layer. A more complex form, useable through the FeatureSearch plugin, allows defining a field configuration for multiple input fields. A full example is as follows: { \"provider\": \"qgis\", \"params\": { \"title\": \"Person search\", \"expression\": { \"persons\": \"\\\"name\\\" ILIKE '%$NAME$%' AND \\\"age\\\" >= $AGE$ AND \\\"gender\\\" = '$GENDER$'\" }, \"fields\": { \"NAME\": {\"label\": \"Name\", \"type\": \"text\"}, \"AGE\": {\"label\": \"Min. age\", \"type\": \"number\", \"options\": {\"min\": 0}}, \"GENDER\": {\"label\": \"Gender\", \"type\": \"select\", \"options\": [{\"value\": \"f\", \"label\": \"Female\"}, {\"value\": \"m\", \"label\": \"Male\"}]} } } } Here, each field will provide a value which is substituted in the expression. Any HTML Input type is supported (i.e. text , number , range , ...), with options depending on the input type. In addition, the select field type is supported to display a ComboBox, with the entries provided as options as in the example above. It is also possible to pass a flat list as options , i.e. [\"Female\", \"Male\"] if the value is equal to the label. Note : qgis provider searches are exposed to the search field only if no fields are specified (i.e. single input search). The FeatureSearch plugin on the other hand will list all qgis provider searches. In addition to the configuration described above, you can specify these additional parameters in params : featureCount : A number, passed as feature_count to the GetFeatureInfo request to control the maximum number of returned features. If not specified, defaults to 100 . resultTitle : A format string for the result title. Allowed placeholders are: {layername} for the layer name and {<fieldname>} for the value of fieldname . If not the layer name followed by the feature displayfield will be shown. description : An arbitrary descriptive text which will be displayed above the search fields in the FeatureSearch plugin. default : Whether the search is selected by default when opening the FeatureSearch plugin. group : A group name, used to group the searches in the FeatureSearch selection combobox.","title":"Configuring the QGIS feature search "},{"location":"topics/Search/#configuring-the-fulltext-search-service","text":"","title":"Configuring the fulltext search service "},{"location":"topics/Search/#solr-configuration","text":"Before the fulltext search service can be configured, a new solr configuration file must be created.
